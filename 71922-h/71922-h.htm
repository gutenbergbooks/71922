<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">These</span> essays are presented to the public in
the belief that though what they contain be
old, it is worth telling again, and in the hope
that by viewing the early history of the
country from a somewhat different stand-point
from that commonly taken, light may
be thrown upon places which have been
sometimes left in shadow.</p>

<p>The time has been when it was considered
a duty to praise every action of the resolute
men who were the early settlers of
New England. In the glow of an exultant
patriotism which was unwilling to see anything
but beauty in the annals of their country,
and in a spirit of reverence which made
them shrink from observing their fathers’
shortcomings, the early historians of the
United States dwelt lovingly on the bright
side of the colonial life, and passed over its
shadows with filial reticence. It is evident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
that no true conception of any period is possible
when so studied, and it is a matter for
congratulation that at the present day the
subject can be treated with greater impartiality,
and that it is no longer necessary for
American writers to make up for the political
and literary insignificance of their country
by boasting either of the vastness of their
continent or of the Spartan virtue of their
forefathers.</p>

<p>In the same manner, in earlier days, when
the recollection of the struggle for independence
was still vivid, patriotic Americans
were unable to recognize anything but arbitrary
tyranny in the attempts made from
time to time by the English government to
give unity and organization to the group of
discordant and feeble settlements, or to see
anything but what was base and servile in
the sentiments that inspired those whom they
nicknamed Tories. Now, under the influence
of calmer consideration, men are beginning
to admit that something may be said
for men like Andros, who strove against the
separatist spirit which seemed to New England
to be the very essence of liberty, and
even for those unfortunates who valued the
connection with Great Britain more than
they did the privileges of self-government,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
and who were compelled in grief and sorrow,
from their devotion to their principles, to
leave forever the homes they loved. The war
of secession has taught Americans to understand
the term, and appreciate the sentiment,
of loyalty. It is no longer an unmeaning
word, fit only to be ridiculed in scurrilous
doggerel by patriot rhymsters, as was the case
a hundred years ago, but appeals to an answering
chord in the heart of every man who
remembers the quick heart-beats and the
grand enthusiasm of those four years of
struggle, the true heroic age of American
history.</p>

<p>The paper upon <i>The Quakers in New England</i>
is an enlargement and revision of an
article printed in the <i>American Church Review</i>,
in April 1889, and that upon <i>Sir Edmund
Andros</i> has been printed by the <i>Historical
Society of Westchester County, N.&nbsp;Y.</i>,
before whom it was read in October 1892,
but it has been revised and enlarged. Instead
of burdening the pages with notes and
references, they have been placed together
after each essay, so that they may be readily
used by those who desire to do so, and yet may
not affront the eyes of those who do not
desire them.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give credit for every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
statement to every historian who may have
made it; it has been the desire of the author
to indicate his principal sources of information,
and he has not knowingly omitted any
work upon which he has relied for the historical
facts presented.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE QUAKERS IN NEW ENGLAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">In</span> the year 1656, in the midst of the period
of the Commonwealth, the good people
of Massachusetts, who were enjoying a brief
season of rest after their troubles with the
Baptists and the Antinomians, heard to their
horror that they were likely to be visited by
certain fanatics of whom they had heard
from their brethren in England. These were
known to them by the invidious name of
Quakers, and were confounded with Adamites,
Muggletonians, and Ranters, strangely
named sects which the confusion of the
times had brought forth.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>This remarkable body of men, whose history
has presented such strange contrasts of wild
enthusiasm and imperturbable stolidity, of
fanaticism and quietism, of contempt for the
world and its rewards on the one side, and of
sordid love of peace and money-getting upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
the other, had recently come into being as
one of the natural results of the unsettling
of religious faiths and practices which had
accompanied the political revolution in England.
The Quaker movement was a revolt
at once from the enforced conformity of the
Laudian establishment and from the intolerable
spiritual oppression of the Calvinistic
divines, whose little fingers, when they came
into power, had been thicker than the loins
of their predecessors.</p>

<p>The great Anglican prelates of the reign of
Charles I. were unfortunate in the circumstances
amidst which their lives were spent.
They were liberal and tolerant in theology,
and they were pilloried as bigots; they
held an idea of what the Church of England
should be, that was utopian in its comprehensiveness,
and they are described by every
New England writer of school histories or
children’s story-books as narrow minded enemies
of freedom of thought. The system
proposed by Andrewes and Montague was
essentially that of Sir Thomas More: liberality
in matters of belief, with uniformity in
practice and in ritual. The Puritan divines,
on the other hand, were despotic in matters of
faith and doctrine to a degree rarely equalled
in the history of the human mind, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
they insisted upon their right of refusing the
system of worship which was established by
law in the Church of England, and of choosing
for themselves religious ordinances to
suit their own tastes and fancies. They did
not plead for liberty on the ground that the
principle of compulsion in religious matters
was wrong and illegitimate, but because the
services of the Church of England were, in
their opinion, unscriptural if not idolatrous.
The one party was tolerant in doctrine, and
despotic, tyrannical at times, in matters of
ritual; the other claimed to be indifferent as
to ritual, but was despotic in opinions. The
church, by attempting to regulate public
worship, was led in some instances to appear
to be persecuting men for doctrinal differences;
the Puritans, from their zeal for orthodoxy
in doctrine, became, when the power
was placed in their hands, the strictest possible
disciplinarians. The tendency of the
one party was to subject the church to the
state, and thus make it an instrument of
political authority; the other tended to the
subjection of the state to the church, making
the civil authority little more than the body
by which the edicts of the ministers should
be registered and their decrees should be
enforced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>With the early history of Quakerism we
have little to do. Its founder, George Fox,
was the son of a weaver at Fenny Drayton
(or Drayton in the Clay) in Leicestershire.
He had been piously brought up by his parents,
who were members of the Church of
England, and passed a boyhood and youth of
singular purity and innocence. When he
was growing up to manhood he passed
through a period of deep religious depression,
and found no help from any of his friends or
from the ministers of the parish churches in his
neighborhood (who at this time were mainly
Presbyterians) or from the newer lights of
the rising separatist bodies. One counselled
him to have blood let, another to use tobacco
and sing psalms; and the poor distracted boy,
whose soul was heavy with a sense of the
wrath of God, found no comfort from any of
them. A careful study of the Bible made
him quick to see the weak points in the systems
that surrounded him, and at last he
found the comfort he sought in the sense of
an immediate communion with God and an
indwelling of the Spirit of Christ within the
soul. For a time he led a solitary life, leaving
home and friends and wandering over
the country on foot, clothed in garments of
leather, sleeping wherever he could find a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
lodging, and spending whole days sometimes
in the hollows of great trees. Soon it was
“borne in upon him” that the presence of
the Spirit and the inner light was as good a
qualification for the office of preacher as that
of being a graduate of Oxford or Cambridge,
and he began his public ministry about the
year 1646.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>With the externals of Quakerism we are
all familiar: the morbid conscientiousness
that forbade the use of the common forms of
courtesy, the simple dress, the refusal to submit
to the authority of magistrates or of
priests in matters concerning religion, and
the unwillingness to pay them the usual compliments
due to their position. The true inner
nature of Quakerism, which gave it its
strength, lay not merely in its abhorrence
of forms and formulas, its vigorous protest
against any compulsion in matters either of
religious thought or religious observance,
but essentially in its consciousness of the
need of the Divine presence and its belief in
the fulfilment of the Saviour’s promise to
send his Spirit into the world.</p>

<p>It was a faith for martyrs and enthusiasts,
a faith which in its simple earnestness had
wonderful power of conviction, but which
was especially liable to counterfeits and pretenders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
who could delude themselves or
others into a belief in their inspiration, and
who substituted a wild extravagance for the
enthusiasm of the first believers. One cannot
help regretting that Fox’s fate placed
him in so uncongenial a century as the seventeenth
and in so matter-of-fact a country as
England. Had he been born in Italy in the
middle ages, his name might rank with that
of Francis of Assisi. But it was impossible
to expect comprehensiveness or liberality
from the Puritans of the day, all the less because
of the abuses and fanatical actions by
which Quakerism was parodied and made
ridiculous. It was essentially an esoteric
religion, and had, in consequence, the great
disadvantage of being able to furnish no
tests by which the true could be distinguished
from the false, those inspired with a genuine
religious enthusiasm from the fanatics and
pretenders.</p>

<p>Their revolt from all established customs
and usages, their disrespect for authority,
and the boldness with which they rebuked
and disputed with the preacher in the pulpit
of the “steeple house” or with the justice
on the bench, brought them at once into difficulties
with the rulers in church and state,
who showed themselves no more tolerant of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
dissent from their own favorite way of thinking
and acting than were the most despotic of
all the Anglican prelates. They were imprisoned,
fined, beaten, and exiled; in 1656 Fox
computed that there were seldom less than
a thousand Quakers in prison at once. They
seemed inspired with a spirit of opposition;
wherever they were not wanted, there were
they sure to go. They visited Scotland and
Ireland, the West India islands and the
American colonies; one woman testified before
the Grand Turk at Adrianople, two others
were imprisoned by the Inquisition at Malta;
one brother visited Jerusalem and bore his
testimony against the superstition of the
monks, others made their way to Rome, Austria,
and Hungary, and a number of them
preached their doctrines in Holland and Germany.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
Such enthusiasm, even in those in
whom it was genuine, was very nearly akin
to insanity; and in many instances the dividing
line was crossed, and the votaries allowed
themselves to commit grotesque and indecent
actions, or to speak most shocking blasphemies
and to receive an idolatrous veneration
from the silly women who listened to their
ravings. The disturbances of the times produced
many other bands of fanatics who were
frequently confounded with the Quakers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
gave to them the odium of their misdeeds.
The Ranters, the Adamites, the Muggletonians,
and the Fifth Monarchy Men were all
akin to the Quakers in being opposed to the
order established by law, and in professing
to be guided by an inner light; they differed
from them, however, in making their religious
fanaticism very often a cloak for secret
vice or for wild plots against the government.
The temporary overthrow of the comprehensive
church establishment of the judicious
statesmen and reformers of Elizabeth’s
reign had opened the gates to a flood of irreligion
and fanaticism. The ecclesiastical
despotism established by the Westminster
Assembly was more repugnant to Englishmen
than the old church which had been suppressed,
and the condition of England in
religious matters during the Commonwealth
forms one of the best apologies for the severe
reactionary measures that were adopted when
the king and the bishops were restored in 1660.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of this period that the
episode of the Quaker troubles in New England
occurred, an episode which has been
given an unpleasant prominence in the
colonial history of New England, partly from
the bitterness of the feelings which were
aroused on both sides, but especially from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
the bearing that it had upon the question of
the people of Massachusetts for the powers
and responsibilities of self-government. The
story is a sad one of misdirected earnestness
and zeal on the one side, of mistaken consistency
and fidelity to principle, however false,
upon the other. We condemn while we
admire; we wonder at the steadiness and
constancy of both judged and judges, while
we regret the tragic results that stained the
new commonwealth with innocent blood.
It is not surprising, however, that such a
conflict took place, for as a recent writer of
great learning and ability has well said of
the relations of the Quakers and their
opponents,—“the issue presented seemed to
have a resemblance to the mechanical problem
of what will be the effect if an irresistible
body strikes an immovable body.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>The colonial governments which had been
established in New England in the first
half of the seventeenth century were not,
as is frequently assumed, homogeneous and
similar, but differed from each other in
their political status and to some extent in
their political institutions, and very greatly
in the spirit which governed and directed
them.</p>

<p>Massachusetts had a charter obtained from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
the Crown for a trading company, and transferred
to the colony by a daring usurpation;
Rhode Island had a charter granted by the
Long Parliament; Plymouth had obtained
its territory by purchase from the old Plymouth
Company, but its political existence
was winked at rather than recognized; Connecticut
and New Haven were, to all intents
and purposes, independent republics, save for
a somewhat doubtful acknowledgment of
the supremacy of the king and of the Commonwealth
that was his successor. All but
Rhode Island were joined together in a federal
league for mutual defence against external
and internal enemies.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the settlement of the
various colonies had been such as to render
the colonists extremely tenacious of their own
privileges, and extremely jealous of any interference
from the other side of the ocean.
The people of Massachusetts, especially, lived
in constant dread of their much-prized charter
being taken away from them by the king,
from whom it had been obtained, or by the
parliament, which considered that it was its
province to meddle with and to regulate all
things in heaven and on earth.</p>

<p>It is quite remarkable that the attitude of
the colonies to the home government, during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the period of the Commonwealth, no less than
in the years which preceded it, was one of
jealous suspicion. The charter colonies
feared that their privileges would be interfered
with, the self-organized colonies were
in dread of a <i lang="la">quo warranto</i> or a <i lang="la">scire facias</i>,
which would disclose the irregularity of their
organizations or the defectiveness of their
titles.</p>

<p>The godly and judicious Winthrop, the
statesmanlike founder and governor of Massachusetts,
had died, sorrowing on his death-bed
for the harshness in religious matters
into which he had been forced; and in his
place was the severe and fanatical Endicott,
a man of gloomy intensity of nature, a stern
logician, a man who neither asked nor
granted mercy. The clergy were fanatically
devoted to their religious and political peculiarities,
and were inferior in wisdom and
judgment to the great leader who had come
out from England with the early settlers
at the beginning of the colony. Cotton was
dead, and was succeeded in his office of teacher
by John Norton, who differed from his predecessor
by the lack of the principal characteristics
which had so greatly distinguished
him: “Profound judgment, eminent gravity,
Christian candor, and sweet temper of spirit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
whereby he could very placidly bear those
who differed from him in other apprehensions.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
Hooker had long since removed to
Connecticut, where he had been largely
instrumental in founding a more genial commonwealth
upon a broader and more liberal
basis. Wilson, the first pastor of the church
at Boston, was indeed still living, but was a
worthy associate of Endicott and Norton,
and distinguished then, as he had always
been, rather by zeal than by either discretion
or Christian charity.</p>

<p>By a process of successful exclusions and
banishments the community had been rendered
tolerably homogeneous, or at least submissive
to the theocratical system which had
been established. Those who had been defeated
in the struggle for existence had gone
elsewhere to found new commonwealths, all
with a greater amount of religious liberty
than that of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The first we hear of the Quakers in New
England is in an order of the General Court
appointing May 14, 1656, as a public day of
humiliation, “to seek the face of God in behalf
of our native country, in reference to the
abounding of errors, especially those of the
Ranters and Quakers.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>About two months later a ship arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
from Barbadoes, bringing as passengers
two Quaker women, Mary Fisher and Ann
Austin. As soon as they arrived in the harbor,
the Governor, the Deputy Governor, and
four assistants met and ordered that the captain
of the ship should be compelled to carry
them back to Barbadoes; that in the mean
time they should be kept in jail, and the books
which they had brought with them should be
burnt. During imprisonment they were subjected
to great indignities and insults at the
hands of the brutal jailer, apparently without
warrant, being stripped naked and their
bodies examined for witch-marks, with attending
circumstances of great indecency. They
were half-starved in prison, and then after a
detention of about a month they were sent
away. No sooner had they gone when another
vessel arrived from England, bringing
eight more, four men and four women, besides
one man from Long Island, who had
been converted during the voyage. Officers
were sent on board the vessel, and the Quakers
were taken at once to the jail, where they
were kept eleven weeks, and then sent back
to England, despite the protests of the shipmaster.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
During their detention they were
examined before the magistrates, and they
increased the abhorrence in which they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
held by their rude and contemptuous answers,
which gave the authorities a sufficient
excuse for keeping them in prison. Their
books were burned; and though some pains
seems to have been taken to convince them of
their errors by argument, it was in vain.
One of the women, Mary Prince by name,
made herself particularly obnoxious by the
eloquence of her abuse. She reviled the
governor from the window of the prison, denouncing
the judgment of God upon him,
wrote violent letters to him and to the magistrates,
and when the ministers attempted
to argue with her, she drove them from her
as “hirelings, deceivers of the people, priests
of Baal, the seed of the serpent, the brood of
Ishmael, etc.”</p>

<p>While this second batch of Quakers was in
prison, the Federal Commissioners were in
session, and resolved to propose to the several
General Courts that all Quakers, Ranters,
and other notorious heretics should be prohibited
coming into the United Colonies,
and if any should hereafter come or arise,
that they should be forthwith secured or removed
out of all the jurisdictions.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> These
recommendations were acted upon by all
the General Courts at their next sessions:
by Connecticut, October 2, 1656; Massachusetts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
October 14, 1656; New Haven, May 27,
1657; Plymouth, June 3, 1657.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts the action of the General
Court was most decided and severe.
Shipmasters who brought Quakers into the
jurisdiction were to be fined one hundred
pounds, and to give security for the return
of such passengers to the port from which
they came. Quakers coming to the colony
were to be “forthwith committed to the
House of Correction, and at their entrance
to be severely whipped, and by the master
thereof to be kept constantly at work, and
none suffered to converse or speak with them
during the time of their imprisonment.” A
fine of five pounds was imposed upon the
importation, circulation, or concealment of
Quaker books; persons presuming to defend
heretical opinions of the said Quakers
should be fined two pounds for the first
offence, four pounds for the second; for the
third offence should be sent to the House of
Correction till they could be conveniently
sent out of the colony; and what person or
persons soever should revile the officer or
person of magistrates or ministers, “as was
usual with the Quakers,” should be severely
whipped, or pay the sum of five pounds.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>It was not long before the law was put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
into operation. The first cases were Ann
Burden and Mary Dyer. They were imprisoned
for two or three months, and then
Burden, after having all of her little property
taken from her in fines and jail charges,
was sent back to England, and Dyer was
delivered to her husband, the Secretary of
Rhode Island, upon his giving security not
to lodge her in any town in the colony nor
permit any to speak with her.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>Mary Clarke, however, who had come
from England “to warn these persecutors to
desist from their iniquity,” was whipped, receiving
twenty stripes with a whip of three
cords, knotted at the ends. Charles Holden
and John Copeland, who had been sent away
the year before, returned to the colony, and
were whipped thirty stripes apiece and imprisoned,
and Lawrence and Cassandra
Southwick were imprisoned and fined for
harboring them. Richard Dowdney, who
arrived from England to bear his testimony,
was scourged and imprisoned, and, together
with Holden and Copeland, was reshipped to
England.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>The authorities now thought that their
laws were too lenient, and in October 1657
they were made more rigorous. The fine
for entertaining Quakers was increased to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
forty shillings an hour, and any Quaker returning
into the jurisdiction after being once
punished, if a man, was to lose one ear, and
on a second appearance to lose the other.
If he appeared a third time, his tongue was
to be bored through with a red-hot iron.
Women were to be whipped for the first and
second offences, and to have their tongues
bored upon the third.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> In May of the following
year, a penalty of ten shillings was
laid upon every one attending a Quaker
meeting, and five pounds upon any one
speaking at such meeting.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>In spite of these severe enactments the
Quakers returned; and the more they were
persecuted, the more they appeared to aspire
to the distinction of martyrdom. Holden,
Copeland, and John Rouse, in 1658, had their
right ears cut off; but the magistrates were
afraid of the effect upon the people of a public
execution of the law, and hence inflicted
the penalty in private, inside the walls of the
prison, in spite of the protest of the unfortunates,
after which they were again flogged
and dismissed.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> In October 1658 a further
step was taken in accordance with the advice
of the Federal Commissioners, who met in
Boston in September, and the penalty of
death was threatened upon all who, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
being banished from the jurisdiction under
pain of death if they returned, should again
come back.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Massachusetts was the only
colony to take this step, which indeed was
carried in the meeting of the Commissioners
by her influence against the protest of Winthrop
of Connecticut; and the measure was
passed by a bare majority of the General
Court after long debate, and with the express
proviso that trial under this act should
be by special jury, and not before the magistrates
alone. Captain Edward Hutchinson
and Captain Thomas Clark, men whose
names should be remembered, desired leave
to enter their dissent from the law. The
Court was urged on to this unfortunate action
by a petition from twenty-five of the
citizens of Boston, among whom we find the
name of John Wilson, the pastor of the First
Church. These represented that the “incorrigibleness”
of the Quakers after all the
means that had been taken was such “as by
reason of their malignant obdurities, daily
increaseth rather than abateth our fear of
the Spirit of Muncer and John of Leyden renewed,
and consequently of some destructive
evil impending,” and asked whether the law
of self-preservation did not require the adoption
of a law to punish these offenders with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
death.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> In order to justify its action, the
Court ordered that there should be “a writing
or declaration drawn up and forthwith
printed to manifest the evils of the teachings
of the Quakers and danger of their practices,
as tending to the subversion of religion, of
church order, and civil government, and the
necessity that this government is put upon
for the preservation of religion and their own
peace and safety, to exclude such persons
from among them, who after due means of
conviction should remain obstinate and pertinacious.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
This declaration was composed
by John Norton, and printed at public expense.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>The rulers of the colony had now committed
themselves to a position from which
they could not recede without loss of dignity,
and which they could not enforce without
great obloquy. They evidently were under the
impression that the mere passage of the law
would be enough, and that they would never
be obliged to proceed to the last extremity.
But they miscalculated the perseverance and
enthusiasm of the men with whom they had
to deal, and were soon involved in a conflict
of will from which there seemed to them to
be no escape except by putting the law into
effect. It would have been better for them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
to have heeded the wise advice that they had
already received from Rhode Island, whose
magistrates had replied to one of the former
communications of Massachusetts requesting
their co-operation in restrictive measures
against the Quakers, in these remarkable
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have no law among us, whereby to punish any
for only declaring by words, etc., their minds and understandings
concerning the things and ways of God,
as to salvation and an eternal condition. And we, moreover,
find that in those places where these people aforesaid
in this colony are most of all suffered to declare
themselves freely, and are only opposed by arguments in
discourse, there they least of all desire to come. And we
are informed that they begin to loathe this place, for
that they are not opposed by the civil authority, but, with
all patience and meekness, are suffered to say over their
pretended revelations and admonitions. Nor are they
like or able to gain many here to their way. Surely, we
find that they delight to be persecuted by civil powers;
and when they are so, they are like to gain more adherents
by the conceit of their painful sufferings than by
consent to their pernicious sayings.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>
</div>

<p>The law was passed in October 1658, and
at first it seemed to have accomplished its
object. The first six Quakers who were
banished after it had been put in force went
away and made no attempt to come back;
but in June 1659 four who were more resolute
and determined appeared in Boston<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
with the avowed intention of defying the
law. They were William Robinson, Marmaduke
Stevenson, Nicholas Davis, and Mary
Dyer. They were arrested and sentenced to
banishment (September 12th), with the threat
that they should suffer death if they remained
or returned to the colony. Nicholas
Davis and Mary Dyer “found freedom to
depart; but the other two were constrained
in the love and power of the Lord not to
depart, but to stay in the jurisdiction, and
to try the bloody law unto death.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> They
withdrew to the New Hampshire settlements,
but in about four weeks returned to Boston
prepared to die, and were joined there by
Mary Dyer, who had decided to share their
fate. They were arraigned before the General
Court, which was then in session, and
admitting that they were the persons banished
by the last Court of Assistants, were
sentenced to be hanged in a week from that
time (October 19th).<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> The authorities evidently
were afraid of popular sympathy, for
they gave orders for a military guard of one
hundred men to conduct them to the gallows,
while another military force was
charged to watch the rest of the town, and
the selectmen were instructed to “press ten
or twelve able and faithful persons every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
night to watch the town and guard the
prison.”</p>

<p>Neither side would yield: the Quakers had
come back with the declared purpose of
dying for their faith and for the principle
of religious liberty; the authorities did not
dare to withdraw from the position in which
they had rashly placed themselves, and the
leaders do not seem to have had any desire
to do so. They felt that the question of
their authority was at stake, and that if
they yielded their power over the people
would be gone. They were willing to claim
for themselves and their institutions the
protection of the laws of England, but they
would not admit any appeal to those laws
when they conflicted with the colonial regulations.
They claimed to own the colony in
full sovereignty, in virtue of their charter
on the one hand and their deeds from the
Indians on the other, and they argued that
they had the same right to exclude obnoxious
and dangerous persons, and to destroy
them if they persistently thrust themselves
upon them, that a householder has of resisting
a burglar, or a shepherd of killing the
wolves that break into his sheepfold.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to say that they had
come to the colony from a zeal for religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
liberty. What they had come for was to
be in a place where they could order religious
affairs to suit themselves. As Besse,
the Quaker historian, shrewdly remarks:
“They appear not so inconsistent with themselves
as some have thought, because when
under oppression they pleaded for liberty
of conscience, they understood it not as the
natural and common right of all mankind,
but as a peculiar privilege of the orthodox.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>The tragedy was performed on the twenty-seventh
day of October 1659; the prisoners,
walking hand in hand, were brought to the
gallows by the soldiers. They were insulted
in their last moments by the bigoted Wilson,
and when they tried to address the people
their voices were drowned by the beating of
the drums. Robinson and Stevenson died
bravely, and Mary Dyer mounted the ladder
to meet her fate; her skirts were tied, the
rope was about her neck, and she was on the
point of being “turned off,” when she was
released by the magistrates in consideration
of the intercession of her son, who had come
up from Rhode Island to try to save his
mother’s life. She unwillingly accepted
the grudging gift, and went back to Rhode
Island.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>The popular feeling was so strong against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
the magistrates for their severity, that they
thought it best to put forth a declaration, in
which they argued that their proceedings
were justified by the law of self-defence, and
by the precedent of the English laws against
the Jesuits; and they calmly stated that
what they had done was only to present the
point of their sword in their own defence,
that the Quakers who had rushed upon it
had become “<i lang="fr">felons de se</i>,” and that their
former proceedings and their mercy to Mary
Dyer upon the “inconsiderable intercession”
of her son “manifestly evinced that they
desired their lives absent rather than their
death present.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The bodies of the unfortunate men were
treated with indecent brutality, and were
buried naked beneath the gallows. Mrs.
Dyer remained away for six months, and
then the spirit moved her to return once
more and die. Her husband wrote to Endicott
to beg her life, but without avail. No
mercy could be shown her as long as she
defied the law. It is said that her life was
offered her if she would promise to keep out
of the colony henceforth, but she declined to
receive the favor.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> “In obedience to the
will of the Lord I came,” said she, “and in
his will I abide faithful to the death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the prisons and the house of
correction had been the fate of other delinquents,
and the jailer and executioner had
had plenty of employment with the scourge.
The Southwicks, with their eldest son Josiah,
were whipped, fined, and imprisoned for
withdrawing from the public services and
worshipping by themselves, and their two
younger children were ordered to be sold
as slaves to the West Indies in satisfaction
of the fines imposed.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> W. Shattuck was
whipped, fined, and imprisoned. Sarah Gibbons
and Dorothy Waugh were whipped.
Hored Gardner, a woman with a sucking
babe, and a young girl who came
into the colony with her, were scourged
with the “three-fold knotted whip, and
during her tortures she prayed for her persecutors.”</p>

<p>William Brand was thrown into the House
of Correction, and, refusing to work, was
beaten constantly by the brutal jailer with a
tarred rope an inch thick. The pathetic
record says: “His back and arms were
bruised black, and the blood was hanging as
in bags under his arms, and so into one was
his flesh beaten that the sign of a particular
blow could not be seen, for all became as a
jelly.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>William Leddra and Rouse, whose ears
had been cut off, were ordered to be whipped
twice a week with increasing severity until
they consented to work, and were at last dismissed
from the colony under pain of death
if they returned.</p>

<p>Patience Scott, a girl eleven years old,
was imprisoned as a Quaker, but discharged,
after a period of detention, in consideration
of her youth; but her mother, Catherine
Scott, for reproving the magistrates for a
deed of darkness, was whipped ten stripes,
although she was admitted by them to be
otherwise of blameless life and conversation.</p>

<p>Christopher Holden, who, in spite of losing
his ears in 1658, had returned once more,
was banished upon pain of death by the same
court that had hanged Robinson and Stevenson.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
Seven or eight persons were fined,
some as high as ten pounds, for entertaining
Quakers, and Edward Wharton, for piloting
them from one place to another, was ordered
to be whipped twenty stripes, and bound to
his good behavior. Divers others were then
brought upon trial, “for adhering to the
cursed sect of Quakers, not disowning themselves
to be such, refusing to give civil
respect, leaving their families and relations,
and roaming from place to place vagabonds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
like”; and Daniel Gold was sentenced to
be whipped thirty stripes, Robert Harper
fifteen, and they, with Alice Courland, Mary
Scott, and Hope Clifton, banished upon pain
of death; William Kingswill whipped fifteen
stripes; Margaret Smith, Mary Trask, and
Provided Southwick ten stripes each, and
Hannah Phelps admonished.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> In November,
William Leddra, who had been released,
returned, and was at once arrested.
On his trial the opportunity of withdrawal
was again extended, but he refused to accept
it, and was executed March 1, 1661. As he
ascended the ladder he was heard to say:
“All that will be Christ’s disciples must
take up the cross,” and just as he was
being thrown from its rounds, he cried in
the words of Stephen, “Lord Jesus,
receive my spirit.” Wenlock Christison, who
had been before this sentenced to death, but
allowed to leave the colony, had returned,
and during Leddra’s trial he came boldly
before the Court and told the astonished
judges: “I am come here to warn you that
ye shed no more innocent blood.” He was at
once arrested, and was brought up for trial
three months later. There was an unusual
difference of opinion in regard to the case,
and the condemnation was only secured by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
the violence of Endicott, who was able to
browbeat the others into consent. But the
sentence they passed was never executed.
The people were tired of bloodshed, and the
opposition which was shown in the General
Court to any further proceedings was so
great as to make a change in the law
necessary.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>The humanity of the delegates to the
Court was probably considerably quickened
by a sense of the dangerous position in
which the colony stood since the restoration
of Charles II., who, they might naturally
fear, would call them to an account for their
proceedings, especially as the colony had
allowed nearly a year to pass without any
recognition of the change in the political
situation.</p>

<p>The General Court attempted to save its
dignity by interposing a still greater number
of shameful and unusual punishments
between the first offence and the death penalty,
and declared that, “being desirous to
try all means with as much lenity as might
consist with safety to prevent the intrusions
of the Quakers, who had not been restrained
by the laws already provided, they would
henceforth order that such intruders should
be tied to a cart’s tail and whipped from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
town to town toward the borders of the
jurisdiction. Should they return after being
dealt with thus thrice, they were to be
branded with the letter R on their left
shoulder, and be severely whipped and sent
away again at the cart’s tail. Should they
again return, they were to be liable to the
former law of banishment under pain of
death.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>It is quite possible that this appeared to be
lenity to men like Endicott and Norton, but
it is very doubtful whether the Quakers
so considered it. It did not prevent, though
it anticipated, an order from the king directing
that any Quakers imprisoned or under
sentence should be released and sent to England
for trial.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> To make this still more
galling to the pride of the colony, it was
sent by Samuel Shattuck, a Salem Quaker,
who had been banished from the colony
under pain of death if he should return, and
who, we cannot doubt, thoroughly enjoyed
his mission and the humiliation of Endicott.
For a short time the order was obeyed and
then the “lenient” laws were put in force
again; and, as many delicately nurtured
Quaker women found to their cost, the
“tender mercies” of the saints were cruel.
Palfrey remarks, with great gratification apparently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
that “no hanging, no branding,
ever took place by force of this law,” but
that “under its provisions for other penalties
the contest was carried on for a considerable
time longer.”</p>

<p>It would be wearisome to cite all of the
subsequent proceedings; a few of them will
suffice to show that the treatment of the
Quakers still continued to be extremely
severe, and that in spite of it all they persisted
in braving the threats of the magistrates.
It was not until 1679, when religious toleration
was forced against their wills upon the
good Christians of Massachusetts, that the
Quakers found any safety within the boundaries
of the colony.</p>

<p>In 1661, when the Quakers were set free
at the command of the king, some of them
were whipped at the cart’s tail twenty stripes
apiece, on the ground that they were vagabonds.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>In 1662, Josiah Southwick, who had returned
from his banishment, was whipped at the
cart’s tail in Boston, Roxbury, and Dedham,
and dismissed into the woods with a warning
not to return. The magistrates apparently
had found that their old style of whipping
was too humane; for the whip used on this
and several subsequent occasions was made,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
not of cord, “but of dried guts like the bass
strings of a bass viol,” with three knots at
each end—a weapon which, according to contemporary
testimony, made holes in the back
that one could put pease into.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>In December 1662 Ann Coleman, Mary
Tompkins, and Alice Ambrose were stripped
to the waist and whipped at the cart’s tail in
Dover, Hampton, and Salisbury, and were
forced to walk the entire distance in slush
and snow up to their knees. The “lenient”
sentence required indeed that they should be
whipped in each town in the jurisdiction, but
the constable at Newbury found in the warrant
some flaw by which he was able to release
them. On their return to Dover, they were
seized by the constables by night, dragged
face downwards over snow and stumps to
the river, one of them at least was doused
in the stream and dragged after a canoe,
and they were only released because the storm
was too severe for their tormentors to brave.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
Ann Coleman, again, with four friends, was
whipped through Salem, Boston, and Dedham.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
Elizabeth Hooton, a woman of over
sixty years of age, Fox’s first convert, was first
imprisoned, and then carried two days’ journey
into the wilderness, “among wolves and
bears,” and left there to shift for herself. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
returning, she was kept in a dungeon at
Cambridge two days without food, tied to the
whipping-post and flogged there, then taken
to Watertown, where she was flogged with
willow rods, flogged again at Dedham, and
then carried into the woods as before.
Coming back once more to fetch her clothes
from Cambridge, she and a companion, “an
ancient woman,” and her daughter were
whipped in private, in spite of which we find
her coming once more to Boston, and on that
occasion she was whipped again at the cart’s
tail.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Mary Tompkins, Alice Ambrose, and
Ann Needham also appear again and again
in the records of suffering. One Edward
Wharton, who was most resolute in defying
the authorities, was constantly under arrest,
and even a bare enumeration of his floggings
would fill a page.</p>

<p>In 1665 Deborah Wilson, for going naked
through the streets of Salem “for a sign,”
was whipped; but the constable executed his
office so mercifully that he was displaced.
There is a pathetic incident mentioned by
Bishop, the Quaker historian, that “her tender
husband, though not altogether of her
way, followed after,” as she underwent her
punishment, “clapping his hat sometimes
between the whip and her back.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>Eliakim Wardwell, at Newbury, was fined
heavily in 1665 for entertaining Wenlock
Christison; and this injustice in addition to
the other cruel acts, so affected his wife
Lydia that, although a modest and delicate
woman, she came naked into the meeting
at Newbury, as a testimony against
them. She was seized and hurried away to
the court at Ipswich, which sentenced her to
be whipped at the nearest tavern post.
Bishop says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Without <i>Law</i> or <i>President</i> <em>they</em> condemned her to be
tyed to the fence Post of the tavern, where they sat,
which is usually their Court places, where they may
serve their ears with Musick, and their bellies with Wine
and gluttony; whereunto <em>she</em> was tyed stript from the
<i>Waste</i> upwards, with her naked breasts to the splinters of
the <i>Posts</i> and there sorely lashed, with <em>twenty</em> or <em>thirty</em>
cruel stripes, which though it miserably tore and bruised
<em>her</em> tender body, yet to the joy of <em>her</em> Husband and Friends
that were Spectators, <em>she</em> was carried through all these
inhumane cruelties, quiet and chearful, and to the shame
and confusion of these unreasonable <em>bruit</em> beasts, whose
name shall rot, and their memory perish.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>
</div>

<p>Eliakim, her husband, some time after, for
vindicating her character, was by order of
the court at Hampton bound to a tree and
whipped fifteen lashes. In 1675 a law was
passed which made it the duty of the constables,
under heavy penalties, to break up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
all Quaker meetings and to commit those
present to the House of Correction, there to
have the discipline of the house and be kept
to work on bread and water, or else to pay
five pounds.</p>

<p>In 1677 an order was passed requiring an
oath of fidelity to the country, and legal
liabilities were imposed upon all who refused
the oath. This struck directly at the
Quakers, and was believed by them, whether
justly or not, to have been made for the
purpose of vexing and plundering them.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
A vigorous protest against it was made in
writing by Margaret Brewster, who came
from Barbadoes to bear her testimony against
the law and to declare the evils that were
coming upon the colony. Having, as she
declared, “a foresight given of that grievous
calamity called the Black Pox, which
afterwards spread there to the cutting off of
many of the People. Wherefore she was
constrained in a prophetic manner to warn
them thereof, by entering into their publick
assembly clothed in sackcloth and ashes, and
with her face made black.” For this she
and four of her friends were arrested and
cast into prison upon the charge of “making
a horrible disturbance, and affrighting
the people in the South Church in Boston<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
in the time of the public dispensing of the
Word, whereby several women ... are
in danger of miscarrying.” She was whipped
at the cart’s tail twenty lashes, and the
young women who were with her were
forced to accompany her during her punishment.
Twelve Quakers, who were arrested
the same day at a Quaker meeting, were
whipped, and fifteen the week following.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>In the other colonies the sufferings of the
Quakers were not so severe, though in Plymouth
they had to endure banishment, fines,
and whippings. In Connecticut, thanks probably
to the wisdom of John Winthrop, the
only cases which occurred were met with
banishment, and the Quakers seem to have
respected the jurisdiction where they were
mercifully treated. In New Haven there
were several prosecutions; Southold on Long
Island seems to have been the place most
frequented by the Quakers, though they also
appeared in Greenwich. The only case of
extreme severity was that of Humphrey Norton,
who had already borne his torturing in
Massachusetts, where he had enraged the
magistrates by his appeal to the laws of
England. He was arrested at Southold and
taken to New Haven, where he was “cast
into Prison and chained to a Post, and kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
night and day for the space of twenty Days
with great Weights of Iron in an open Prison
without Fire or Candles in the bitter cold
Winter (December 1657), enough (reasonably)
to have starved him,” as Bishop writes.
When he attempted to reply to Davenport in
the Court, he was not suffered to speak, but
was gagged with “a great Iron Key, tied
athwart his mouth.” After his trial was
over he was whipped thirty stripes and
branded H in the hand.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> Several who sympathized
with or who entertained Quakers
were punished with heavy fines. In New
Netherlands they fared little better;<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> and in
Virginia the much-flogged Mary Tompkins
and Alice Ambrose found little mercy from
the cavaliers, being put in the pillory and
whipped with a cat-of-nine-tails so severely
that blood was drawn by the very first stroke;
and George Wilson, “in cruel irons that
rotted his flesh, and long imprisonment, departed
this life for his testimony to the
Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> In Maryland they were subjected
to fine and imprisonment for refusing to
take an oath or to serve in the militia.
Liberty of conscience was granted in 1688.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>It was in New England, and especially in
Massachusetts, that the persecution was
general and severe. The magistrates, as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
rule, defended their action, as necessary to
the maintenance of their authority and to
the preservation of order and orthodoxy; and
their conduct has been extenuated and excused,
if not actually defended, by modern
New England historians.</p>

<p>It is not a pleasant history, but there is
something to be said upon the side of the authorities
even by one who has no admiration
for them or sympathy with them. The
Puritans had not come to New England for
liberty of thought, but for liberty of action.
Having failed, as they thought at the time,
to secure the triumph of their views in the
church and state of England, they preferred
to leave the struggle and come to New England,
where they could live under their own
system without being obliged to contend or
suffer for their faith—a point upon which the
Quaker controversialists make some very
sharp remarks.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>They considered the territory which they
held to be their own <i lang="la">peculium</i>, and claimed
that by their charter they had acquired
absolute sovereignty in its limits, subject to
no appeal to England; and they realized
that if appeal to England was granted, their
absolute authority was at an end. One of
the leading colonists is reported to have said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
“If we admit appeal to the Parliament this
year, next year they will send to see how it
is, and the third year the government will
be changed.” The settlement also had in
their eyes a religious character; it was
founded, as they boasted, for religion and
not for trade, and they held that they had a
right to dictate the religious usages and
practices therein, as was shown by their
treatment of Mrs. Hutchinson and Wheelwright,
Roger Williams and Gorton, Child
and Maverick, not to mention Morton of
Merry Mount. They believed the Quakers
to be a pernicious sect, confounding them
with other fanatical bodies which they resembled,
and they feared that the natural
consequence of the claim which they made to
immediate revelation would be communistic
attempts at the overthrow of the established
order, such as had been seen a hundred years
before in Germany. From these premises
the conclusion was a natural one, that their
duty was to nip the evil in the bud, to crush
the Quakers before they became strong
enough to be dangerous to the state. Their
action in banishing the first that arrived,
before any overt acts were committed, was
undoubtedly technically illegal; but if the
Quakers had been in reality what they fancied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
them, no one would have blamed them for
their prompt decision. Besides, they had a
law by which they were accustomed to banish
heretics, and the Quakers might very well
come under that description.</p>

<p>As regards the compelling shipmasters to
carry them back to the port from which they
had come, such a custom had prevailed from
a very early date in the case of undesirable
immigrants. Winthrop, in his History
mentions the reshipping to England of a
crazy pauper woman whom the parish of
Willesden had sent over to the colonists in
Massachusetts. The Quakers came in spite
of banishment, and the more they were imprisoned
and beaten the more daring became
their defiance, the more violent their abuse.
They spared neither priest nor magistrate,
and the floods of denunciation which they
poured out were portentous. It is not to be
wondered at that a stern and severe people,
living a hard and cruel life of constant
struggle with the elements, and in the constant
dread lest their privileges should be
assailed, should have been cruel in their
treatment of these incorrigible offenders.</p>

<p>Judged by the common standard of the
age, the cruelty of the treatment of the
Quakers is not so remarkable as to be singled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
out above all other cruelties for reprobation.
The Quakers themselves were cruel at times.
George Fox himself is said to have been a
witch-finder; and a son of the Samuel
Shattuck who bore the king’s mandate to
Endicott appears in the Salem witchcraft
trials as a prominent witness against some
of the unfortunates.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The folly and fatuity
of the treatment adopted is more of a point
to notice. In the colonies where the Quakers
were let alone they caused no trouble.
Palfrey’s sneer, that there was no order to
disturb in Rhode Island, may be justified
perhaps as regards that colony, but Connecticut
certainly was a well-ordered commonwealth.
In Massachusetts, on the contrary,
the same persons kept coming again
and again, and the severer the punishments
the madder became their actions. It should
be remembered that the acts usually mentioned
as justifying the Puritans’ severity,
such as the performances of the naked
women at Salem and Newbury, of the men
who broke bottles on the pulpit steps, and of
the woman who smeared her face with black
and frightened the matrons in the Old
South church, were not committed until
after the persecution had been carried on for
years, until scores of women had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
stripped naked and flogged by the authorities,
until men had had their ears cut off, and
until three men and one woman had been
put to death upon the gallows. The persecution
was a blunder, and the details of it
made it a blunder of the most atrocious
description. Power was put into the hands
of local and irresponsible magistrates to
sentence men and women to these shameful
and unusual punishments, and brutal constables
and jailers were entrusted with the
enforcement of the law without any due
supervision. The most painful part of the
whole history is the attitude of the Puritan
clergy, in Massachusetts especially. They
were bitter and bigoted, hounding on the
magistrates to their cruel work, and insulting
the unfortunate wretches when they came
to suffer. Quaker instinct rightly, no doubt,
fixed upon John Norton as the “Fountain
and Principal unto whom most of the cruelty
and bloodshed is to be imputed.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>For the constancy of the Quakers themselves,
their endurance and their fortitude,
one can feel nothing but admiration. One
remembers how, centuries before, men who
like them were willing to die rather than to
deny their faith had been called the enemies of
mankind, and accused of a perverse and execrable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
superstition. It must be admitted, however,
that their behavior was often of a kind
that would not be allowed to-day any more
than it was then, although it is to be hoped
that our modern statecraft would find milder
and more efficient means of repression than
did our predecessors in New England; yet
when one remembers how the Mormons were
treated in Illinois and Missouri, and how the
mob destroyed a Roman Catholic convent in
Massachusetts, within the memories of living
men, we may think it perhaps prudent not
to be too sweeping in our condemnation.</p>

<p>The fundamental difficulty in the Puritans’
position was their illegal and unconstitutional
government. To maintain that, they were
led to deny to other Englishmen their rights,
and to assert an independence of the home
authorities which was little short of actual
separation.</p>

<p>The second evil principle in their government
was the union of church and state, or
rather the subjection of the state to the
church, a church moreover in which the
people had no rights except by favor of the
ministers, a church that was a close corporation
and imbued with the spirit of the law
of Moses rather than that of the gospel of
Christ. In church, as well as in state, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
was a consciousness that their existence was
illegal and illegitimate; that, in spite of their
protests to the contrary, they had separated
from their fellow-Christians in England and
had formed a polity for themselves; hence,
just as they felt it necessary to manifest
their political authority by acts of severity
upon any who questioned it, so they deemed
it necessary to maintain their orthodoxy by
persecuting those who differed from them in
religion. They were ill at ease both politically
and religiously, and they sought to disguise
the fact from themselves, by making proof
of all the power that they possessed. Hence
it was that the conflict arose which has stained
with innocent blood the early history of the
land. It is not to be wondered that the
Quakers should see, in the horrible death of
Endicott and the miserable end of Norton,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
the hand of an avenging Providence, or that
they should believe that for a distance of
twenty miles from Boston the ground was
cursed so that no wheat could ripen because
of a blood-red blight that fastened upon it.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
But we, who live at a time when we can
view the history of the struggle with calmness
and impartiality, may respect the grim
determination of the severe magistrates
who felt it their duty, at whatever cost, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
keep that which was committed to their
trust free from the poison of heresy and
fanaticism, while we sorrow at the blindness
which hid from their eyes the folly and the
cruelty of their proceedings. We may sympathize
with the tortured Quakers, whom we
now know to be harmless enthusiasts, yet
without approving or extenuating their mad
actions, their abusive language, or their
grotesque indecencies; and we may hope that,
though at enmity in this life, yet, as Browning
wrote of Strafford and Pym,</p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">2</a> George Fox, <i>Journal</i>. It is well to notice that of
the ministers mentioned by Fox by name or parish,
Nath. Stevens, the rector of Fenny Drayton, was a Presbyterian
of some eminence, and was ejected for non-conformity
in 1662. So also was Matthew Cradock, the
“priest of Coventry,” who was a distinguished non-conformist
divine. The priest at Mansetter, who advised
tobacco and psalm-singing, kept his living during the
whole period of the Commonwealth, and so may be presumed
not to have been a “Churchman” in the commonly
received sense of the term. “One Macham,” of whom
Fox speaks, and who seems to have treated him with more
sympathetic kindness than any of the others, was a loyal
Churchman and was sequestered in 1645, as a penalty for
his adherence to the bishop and the king to whom he had
sworn allegiance. It is rather surprising to find historians
in general, even those who should be better informed,
assuming that, because these men were filling
the parishes of the Church of England, they were, therefore,
Church of England clergymen.</p>

of the Present Generation.</i> Printed by <i>Samuel Green</i>,
<i>Cambridge in New England</i>, 1659. The arguments used
in this declaration are so characteristic of the spirit of the
times that the following extract may be useful. The
author has been demonstrating that the Quakers were
heretical on various points of the faith, and that the Scriptures
authorize the punishment of false believers. He
continues:</p>

<p>“But other Scriptures omitted, I shall here transcribe
only two more, both of which are eminently pregnant
with this truth: wherein also are cases put between the
cause of God and our near relations, on purpose to provide
against obstructions in this great business of religion.</p>

<p>The first we have <i>Deut.</i> xiii. <i lang="la">per totum</i>.</p>

<p>Relating to all times succeeding that constitution; ‘<i>If
thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy
daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which
is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go
and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou,
nor thy fathers; Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor
hearken unto him; neither shalt thine eyes pity him,
neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him.</i>’
vers. 6, 8. The second we have <i>Zech.</i> xiii. 1, 3. <i>Expressly
relating unto the times of the Gospel. In that day</i>,
viz.: after the Coming of the Messiah in the time of the
Gospel <i>when the families of the tribes shall mourne Chapt.</i>
xii. 11. <i>The familie of the house of David apart, &amp; the
familie of the house of Nathan apart, etc. There shall
be a fountain opened</i>, <i>i. e.</i> the doctrine of Christ under
Moses’ dispensation is compared to <em>a fountain vailed</em>,
2 Cor. iii. 13, etc. Under the Gospel dispensation to a
<em>fountain opened</em>. The vail of the Temple &amp; the ceremonial
law being taken away. <i>And it shall come to pass that
when any shall yet Prophecie, then his father &amp; his mother
that begat him, shall thrust him through, when he prophecieth.</i>
These words [thrust him through] may be understood
either of a Capital punishment judicially dispensed,
or of any other smart punishment piercing though not
Capital.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>“Wee through grace abhorre prejudicing the liberty
of conscience the least measure, and account such report
of us to be a slander. And through the same grace;
Wee both dread, and beare witness against, liberty of
heresy, liberty to Blaspheme the Blessed Trinity, the Person
and Office of Christ, the holy-Scripture, the tabernacle
of God, and those that dwell in heaven. Howsoever fallaciously
transformed into, and misrepresented under the
plausible vizard of liberty of conscience falsely so called.
We say Religion is to be perswaded with Scripture-reasons,
not Civil weapons: with Arguments, not with
punishments. But blasphemies immediate and heresies
carried on with an high hand, and persisted in are to
be suppressed with weapons and punishments; where
reasons, and arguments cannot prevail.</p>

<p>We distinguish between Heresie (Quiet and alone, Turbulent,
i. e. incorrigible) accompanied with soliciting the
people to apostacy from the Faith of Christ to defection
from the churches, to Sedition in the Commonwealth.
And that after due meanes of conviction, and Authoritative
prohibition.</p>

<p>We subject not any to Civil or Corporal punishment for
heresie, if <em>quiet and alone</em>. We do not inflict any Church-censure
in case of heresie, without doctrinal conviction
on the Churche’s part, and contumacy on the delinquent’s
part foregoing.</p>

<p>In case of <i>Heresie incorrigible</i>, in conjunction with endeavours
to seduce others thereunto, and tending to the
disturbing of Publick-order, we acknowledge it to be the
pious Wisdom of the Magistrate to proceed gradually,
and where gentler meanes may rationally be looked at as
effectual, there to abstain from the use of any severer
remedie.</p>

<p>And according to this method, hath been the gradual
proceeding of the Magistrate here, with those (hitherto
incorrigible) <i>Quakers</i>, who from England have unreasonably
and insolently obtruded themselves upon us. 1. Instructing
them. 2. Restraining them untill an opportunity
for their returne. 3. Publishing a law to warne and
prohibite both them and all others of that sect, from
Coming into this jurisdiction: otherwise to expect the
house of Correction. And in case they returned yet again,
then to loose one of their eares, etc.</p>

<p>At last upon experience of their bold contempt of these
inferior restraints, and that after their being sent away
again and again, they continue to return yet again and
again; to the seducing of diverse, the disturbance, vexation
and hazard of the whole Colonie. The Court finding
the Law passed, to be an insufficient fence against these
persons, proceeded to a Sentence of Banishment.</p>

<p>Their restraint before the Law published, was but
restraint in the Prison, until an opportunity of shipping
them away. They who after the Law was published,
would that notwithstanding, break in upon us from England,
or other forraign parts, by Rode-Island, after their
correction received, and discharging their dues, might
return again to the Island, if they pleased. The wolfe
which ventures over the wild Sea, out of a ravening desire
to prey upon the sheep, when landed, discovered and
taken, hath no cause to complain, though for the security
of the flock, he be penned up, with the door opening unto
the fold fast shut; but having another door purposely
left open, whereby he may depart at his pleasure either
returning from whence he came, or otherwise quitting
the place.</p>

<p>Their <i>Sentence of Banishment</i> as Circumstanced, by an
Impartial and equal eye, may be looked upon as an Act
which the court was forced unto <i lang="la">se defendendo</i>, in defence
of Religion, themselves, the Churches, and this poore
State and People from Ruine: which the principles of
confusion, daylie and studiously disseminated by them,
threatened to bring all unto, if not seasonably prevented.
<i>Exile from a wilderness</i>, from a place of exile; though
voluntarie, from a place; confinement whereunto would
indeed justly be called exile, is an <em>easie exile</em>.” (Pages

<span class="subhead">THE WITCHES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> story of the witchcraft delusion in
New England is a sequel and companion-piece
to the history of the conflict with the
Quakers. Both exhibit the least attractive
side of our forefathers, and both point the
moral that the intermeddling by ecclesiastics
in matters of public policy is dangerous to
the state. It is a strange tale of superstition
and of panic, painful to dwell upon, but necessary
to a proper comprehension of the
characters of the leaders of New England,
and of the conditions under which the struggling
colonies developed their strong and
distinct individuality. It should always be
remembered that belief in witchcraft was
not a peculiarity of New England, and that
the reason the colonists there have been
judged so hardly for their panic is that
men have felt that they had claimed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
superior to the men of their generation, and
thus should be measured by a higher standard.
Their claim had some justification.
The leaders of thought in New England had
advanced in some directions far beyond their
contemporaries; in political insight and
political adroitness they have had few equals
in any period; but they were hampered and
burdened by the very religion which to their
fathers had been a gospel of liberty and a
source of inspiration. This had become a theology
with its dogmas and its rules; the devout
and earnest ministers who had contended
for their faith in England, or had
braved the perils of the seas and the loneliness
of the wilderness to be free to worship
God as they chose, had given place to the
second generation, who had never known
suffering, and were therefore ignorant of
mercy; men who were enthusiastic indeed,
but not so much enthusiastic for religion as
for their creed; not so zealous for Christ as
for their own peculiar way of worshipping
him. The result had been a general lowering
of spiritual tone, which was recognized
and freely acknowledged and deplored by the
best men of the period. It seems inevitable
that this hardening and narrowing should
follow ages of contest and struggle. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
the faith becomes a war-cry, it necessarily
loses much of its spirituality. Beliefs for
which one age has suffered become crystallized
into formulas for the next, and divines
wonder at the hardness of men’s hearts in
refusing obedience to what once indeed had
been a law of life, but by being made a commandment
has become a law unto death.</p>

<p>So, while our New England forefathers
were clever politicians, shrewd and adroit
men of affairs, practical and full of ingenious
expedients, intelligent and clear-headed
about their secular business, they retrograded
in religion, and became formalists and controversialists.
Theological orthodoxy supplanted
intelligent Christianity, and New
England religion sank into a dreary series
of wranglings about Cambridge platforms
and Saybrook platforms, half-way covenants
and whole-way covenants, old lights
and new lights, consociations and associations,
until it became, for a time at least,
more arid and lifeless than ever had been the
Church of England, against the formalism of
which they were continually protesting. It is
true that a few isolated cases of witchcraft
are found occurring in the early history of the
colonies, and it was then that the severe laws
were enacted; yet the serious trouble, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
great panic, did not come until the first generation,
“those men who had seen the works
of the Lord,” had been gathered unto their
fathers. One cannot imagine John Cotton
playing the part of his namesake Cotton
Mather, or John Winthrop, superstitious as
he was, in the place of Stoughton. Even
Wilson and Norton, who exulted in the blood
of the Quakers, thought witch-finding a
cowardly yielding to popular folly. The
responsibility of the men of the first generation
lies rather in the character of the
religious training they gave their successors,
a gloomy religion, which in themselves had
been mitigated by a piety, sincere if fanatical,
and perhaps also by some recollection of the
brighter experiences of their childhood’s
days in the more genial religious life of
England, a life their children had never
known.</p>

<p>It is, then, not astonishing that our forefathers
in New England should have been
victims to a common delusion of their times.
We may even say that the circumstances of
their lives were such as to render them especially
liable to it; for though the hardships of
the early history of the settlement grew less
as time went on, the life in New England
was, at the best, lonely and depressing. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
colonists lived dreary lives of laborious and
uninteresting toil, with few physical comforts,
and with poor and unvaried diet. They
had few amusements, little or no recreation,
and they were constantly in face of difficulties,
constantly exposed to danger. Their
houses were on the verge of the mysterious
forest, where strange sights and sounds
were to be seen and heard, where dwelt the
Indians, often hostile and always a source
of uneasiness. They had few books, and
those they had were not of a character to
draw them away from the contemplation of
themselves. The Bible they had, it is true,
but to read it for any purpose except that of
spiritual exercise would have been deemed
profane. Sermons of abnormal length and
dryness, controversial treatises, ponderous
alike literally and figuratively, and, as we
shall see later, ghastly and blood-curdling
accounts of memorable providences, formed
their principal literature. The settlers had
been for the most part emigrants from quiet
country towns and villages in England, put
down in the unknown wilderness, to work out,
under the pressure of religious enthusiasm, a
new social and religious polity. The life was
small, narrow, and squalid, only redeemed
from utter sordidness by gleams of religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
idealism and by the stern resolution of the
better class of the settlers to keep themselves
and their neighbors in the paths of righteousness.
Their religion was a sombre Calvinism,
giving more prominence to the terrors
of the law than to the comforts of the
gospel. Living as they did in scriptural
thought, speaking in scriptural phraseology,
dwelling constantly upon the similarity of
their position with that of the children of
Israel, it is not surprising that they should
have carried their intense literalism into
every particular. Their external relations,
their religious and political systems, were
ruled by the law of Moses as they imagined
it from their somewhat uncritical study of
the Old Testament. Their Christianity was
profoundly internal and introspective, something
which was between each individual
soul and the Almighty, rather than a law of
social life. The result of this was twofold.
They were led to ascribe to their own convictions
the character of divine revelations,
and were also rendered intensely morbid,
sometimes exalted above measure and sometimes
as irrationally despondent. They felt
that they were the chosen people of the Lord,
doing a great work for him, in “setting up
the candlestick of a pure church in the wilderness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
to which the like-minded might resort”;
and this feeling led them to believe
that they were especially exposed to the
malice and spite of the devil, who desired to
thwart their purpose. They saw special
providences in every common occurrence
that made for their welfare or that seemed
to vindicate their theological prejudices, the
envy and spite of the devil in every misadventure
or threatening circumstance. Cotton
Mather may be taken as a characteristic
specimen of the more intelligent and devout
thinkers among the men of the second generation,
and for him the whole daily life of
the colony was a spiritual warfare. The
very object of his greatest work, the “Magnalia
Christi,” is to show the special workings
of Divine Providence in favor of the
people of Massachusetts, and to exhibit how
they had battled against “principalities and
powers, against the rulers of the darkness
of this world, against spiritual wickedness
in high places.” The savage Indians were
supposed to be devil-worshippers, and to
serve him at their “pow-wows” in the dark
recesses of the unbroken forest. Every
storm, every meteor, every unnatural birth,
was a portent.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> It is not strange that under
such conditions a strong belief in the reality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
of witchcraft should have existed, especially
when the delusion was general in Europe as
well as in America.</p>

<p>The belief in the power of evil spirits to
interfere with man has been held in every
age and in all parts of the world. It is a
survival of that fear of the unseen, which
filled the souls of men in those early ages
when, ignorant of the forces of nature, they
felt the universe about them to be hostile
and ascribed all unfamiliar sensations to the
agency of some invisible enemy. It is not
strange that such a belief should have arisen.
Man’s commonest experiences were those of
hostility and pain; wild animals were hostile,
his wilder fellow-men were still more hostile;
from both he suffered injuries that were inflicted
consciously and with evil intent; by
analogy—the earliest, as it is the latest, form
of reasoning—the other evils he suffered
must be also the acts of conscious beings.
The twinges of rheumatism were no less real
than the pain from the blow of a foeman’s
club; it was only natural to reason that
they had been inflicted by an unseen enemy.</p>

<p>The fear of the unseen, so characteristic of
primeval man, has left many traces in language,
religion, and custom. Like many another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
instinct inherited from savage life, it
remains lurking in the human mind, and at
certain times comes to the surface. It has
developed itself in two directions. On the
one hand it has led to religion, to a faith
in a supernal Protector with whom the darkness
and the light are both alike; on the
other, to a grovelling fear of evil spirits,
which has been the cause of the belief in
magic, sorcery, and witchcraft. The fear of
Jehovah was, for Israel and for the world,
the beginning of wisdom. The “seeking
unto wizards that peep and mutter” is the
parody of religion, which seems always to
exist by its side.</p>

<p>It is probable also that the belief in evil
spirits may have had, in some cases, a different
origin. It has been often pointed out on historical
as well as on philological grounds
that, in many cases, the conquest of one tribe
by another has degraded the religion of the
conquered into a secondary and dishonorable
position. When the Saxon convert renounced
Woden, Thunor, and Saxnote and all
their words and works, the gods of Asgard
still remained, in the belief of both convert
and converter, as malignant enemies of
Christianity. Whether from a primitive
fear or a degraded polytheism, the result has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
been the same; man tends to surround himself
with a host of invisible foes.</p>

<p>The monotheistic religions, especially, have
waged a bitter warfare upon this form of polytheism,
as derogating from the honors due
only to the highest. Judaism, Christianity,
and Islam have all declared war against the
witch and the magician, at times by stern
legislation, at times by wise teaching of the
unreality and nothingness of the pretences
of those who claim supernatural powers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most strange fact in the history
of the subject, and a remarkable example of
the impossibility of anticipating every result
of an action, is that the very efforts which
were made by the enlightened lawgivers of
Israel to eradicate this debasing superstition
have been in later times the provocation of
the continued recurrence of the delusion.
The words of the law of Israel have been
used to prove the reality of the existence of
the offence it had attempted to obliterate,
while the severity of the punishments employed
among a people just rescued from
barbarism has been made an excuse for
equal severity under circumstances the most
widely different.</p>

<p>Even now such superstitions are extremely
common among the negroes of the southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
portion of the United States, and of the West
India Islands, as they are among the Slavs
in Bohemia and Russia, and among the ignorant
in every land. Even among the educated
classes there is a more than half-serious belief
in “charms,” “mascots,” and “hoodoos,”
which is laughed at but acted upon. The
superstitions about Friday, the number thirteen,
and many others of the same nature,
are still acted upon all over the world, and
the belief in the evil eye is not confined
to any one class or nation. Spiritualistic
materializations and the marvels of Hindu
theosophy are modern examples of this same
recurrence to the fears and follies of our
savage ancestors.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, it was only a
few emancipated spirits who did not so believe,
and they were looked upon with horror
by the majority of religious men as Sadducees
and unbelievers. No less an authority
than King James himself, the British Solomon,
had written a most “learned and painful”
treatise to prove the necessity of such
a belief for all Christian people, a treatise in
which he expounded satisfactorily, to himself
at least, all the most recondite minutiæ
of the subject.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>In his reign, by Act of Parliament, witchcraft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
had been made punishable by death,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> and
the scandalous case of Lady Essex’s divorce
had been decided on grounds of “maleficium
versus hanc.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> Still more recently, as the
wise and godly Baxter relates, during the
period of the Commonwealth, the learned
Calamy had looked on with approval, while
Matthew Hopkins, the witch-finder, tortured
some poor wretches, among whom was one
unfortunate dispossessed clergyman of the
persecuted Church of England, into confessing
revolting absurdities.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> Still later, after
the Restoration, the usually judicious Sir
Matthew Hale had condemned and burned
two women as witches, in the very Suffolk
from which so many of the New Englanders
had come, on evidence of the same character
as that upon which American courts had to
decide.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> If these erred in believing in witchcraft,
they erred in good company, with all
the most orthodox teachers of religion and
philosophy in Europe, Protestant and Catholic
as well. Even Selden, who had no belief in
witchcraft himself, justified the severity
which was exercised against those condemned
of that offence, by arguing that if a man
thought that by turning his hat around and
saying “Buz” he could kill a man, he ought
to be put to death if he made the attempt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
no matter how absurd the claim might be.
Sir Thomas Browne, the well-known author
of the <i>Religio Medici</i>, gave his testimony as
an expert at the trial of the Suffolk witches,
upon the side of the reality of witchcraft.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
When the student of the early annals of the
Colonies realizes the extent of this superstition,
and at the same time the literal character
of the religion of the majority of the
settlers in New England, their bitter hatred
of theological opponents, and their readiness
to believe evil in regard to them; when he
appreciates how harsh and mean and unlovely
was the life that most of them lived, and
observes that, side by side with an exalted religious
enthusiasm, the lowest and most abhorrent
forms of indecency and vice prevailed,
he will no longer be inclined to wonder
at the existence in such a community of
the witchcraft delusion, but will rather be
amazed that, with such a people and among
such surroundings, its duration was so short
and its victims so few.</p>

<p>Although the crime of witchcraft was especially
named in the colonial statutes, and the
penalty of death imposed upon offenders, it
was some time before a case was detected; and
the early settlers seem usually to have acted
most cautiously in this matter. Connecticut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
has the unenviable pre-eminence of having
furnished the first victim, if Winthrop may be
believed. He notes: “One of Windsor was
arraigned and executed in Hartford for a
witch” in March, 1646–7.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Then followed,
in 1648, the execution of Margaret Jones at
Charlestown, Mass., whose fate Winthrop
also describes. She was tested according to
the most approved maxims of witch-finders
in England, being stripped and searched for
witch-marks, or the teats by which it was
believed the devil’s imps were nourished.
The search paid no regard to decency, and
when the inquisitors found some small excrescence
they were fully satisfied of the
guilt of the accused, and she was accordingly
hanged.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> In the same year the founders of
the liberties of Connecticut put to death, at
Hartford, one Mary Johnson, with whom, it
is related, “Mr. Stone labored with such success
that she died in penitence, confessing
her abominable crimes of familiarity with
the devil.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> In 1650, a Mistress Lake was
hanged at Dorchester, and a Mistress Kendall
at Cambridge, showing that not all the
superstitious had migrated from those places
to Hartford and Windsor.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> In 1651, Mary
Parsons of Springfield was hanged for infanticide;
she was generally accused of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
a witch, but on trial before the General
Court was cleared, owing to the insufficiency
of the testimony;<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> and Hugh Parsons, her
husband, who was tried and found guilty by
the Court of Assistants in 1652, was re-tried
and acquitted by the General Court, “which,
after perusing and considering the evidence,
... judged that he was not legally guilty
of witchcraft, and so not to dye by law.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>
These instances of careful examination, as
well as the small number of the cases, show
that in the first twenty-five years there was no
general panic, and that the authorities were
inclined to proceed with a deliberation which
contrasts very favorably with the tone of
feeling in England at this time. In 1651,
Goodwife Bassett was hanged at Stratford,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>
and John Carrington and his wife of
Wethersfield, probably at Hartford,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> and in
1653, Goodwife Knapp suffered at Fairfield.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
In Massachusetts there were no more cases
until 1656, in which year Mistress Hibbins,
a woman of position, whose husband had sat
as an assistant at some of the earlier trials,
was hanged in Boston. It is noticeable in
her case that though the magistrates had
refused to accept the verdict of the first jury
that had found her guilty, the General Court,
to whom the case came in regular course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
condemned her.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> Her execution shocked
the wiser portion of the community, and
even men of the narrow religious views of
Norton and Wilson, though they did not
venture openly to oppose the popular demand
for her life, were heard to say in private that
they had hanged a woman whose chief offence
was in having more wit than her neighbors.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>After her death there were no more executions
in Massachusetts for over thirty years,
though the increasing frequency of marvellous
occurrences and suspicious cases promised
ill for the future. Good sense as yet
controlled public affairs, in this direction at
least. In Connecticut witch-finding still continued;
in 1558 the wife of Joseph Garlick
of Easthampton (L.&nbsp;I.) was tried for this
offence; in 1659 there was an alarm in Saybrook;
and in 1662, one Goody Greensmith of
Hartford was convicted, on her own confession,
of having had carnal intercourse with the
devil, and was hanged for the offence; two
other women were condemned with her but
“made their escape”; her husband was not
so fortunate and was put to death. Mary
Barnes of Farmington was indicted January
6th, 1662–3, and was probably executed with
the Greensmiths.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>Other cases occurred, but it is believed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
this was the last execution for witchcraft in
Connecticut. The Gallows Hill in Hartford
was, however, long remembered, and has not
even yet lost its unsavory reputation. The
political changes incident to the reception
of the charter, by which the colony of New
Haven was calmly absorbed by its astute and
ambitious neighbor, seem to have occupied
men’s minds sufficiently to keep them from
any great amount of activity in this direction.
Yet, in 1665, Elizabeth Seger was
found guilty of witchcraft at Hartford, but
set at liberty, and, 1669, Katharine Harrison
of Wethersfield was tried and condemned;
the verdict, however, was overruled and the
prisoner released by the Special Court of Assistants;<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>
four women were tried in 1692, at
Fairfield, one of whom was condemned to
death, but not executed; two women were
indicted at Wallingford, and a woman was
tried at Hartford as late as 1697, but acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
It has sometimes been said that
the arrival of Andros and the loss of the
charter in 1687 was the only thing that prevented
a serious outbreak of the delusion in
Connecticut.</p>

<p>When the delusion revived in Massachusetts
it was with increased force and virulence.
Its recrudescence may be directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
traced to the publication and general circulation
in the colony of a book by Increase
Mather, entitled “An Essay for the recording
of Illustrious Providences,” etc., which
contained a detailed account of all the marvels
that Divine benevolence or wrath had
wrought in the last thirty or forty years.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
At about the same time appeared the account
of the trials in England under Sir Matthew
Hale<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> and of the remarkable mania which
had raged in Sweden in 1669.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> These horrible
stories became the subject of conversation,
of meditation in private, and of sermon
and prayer in public. They were apparently
read or related to the young as edifying and
instructive literature; for, from this time
forward, children in New England began to
repeat the phenomena that had prevailed
on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The colony was in a very excited and discontented
condition. The beloved patent
upon which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
had been so boldly reared had been taken
away from them, and they had been brought
under the government of England. Their
“purity of doctrine” was more than threatened,
as not only had they been compelled to
desist from persecuting Quakers, but they
had also been constrained to allow the hated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
<i>Book of Common Prayer</i> to be read in public,
and to permit men to worship God according
to its rubrical provisions. More than
this, the king’s governor had actually polluted
one of their meeting-houses by using it
for the performance of the services of the national
church. It seemed indeed to many of
the men who were now prominent in the room
of their wiser fathers, that Satan was making
a desperate attack upon the colony; and their
minds were predisposed to believe any marvels
the result of diabolical agency.</p>

<p>The first manifestation of the revived delusion
appeared in 1688, in the family of
John Goodwin, a sober and prosperous mechanic
of Boston. His children, all of whom
were said to be remarkable for “ingenuity
of character,” and who had been religiously
brought up, and were “thought to be without
guile,” suddenly exhibited the most
alarming symptoms. One of them, a young
girl, had given some offence to an old Irishwoman
of bad character, and had been repaid
with vigorous abuse and vituperation.
Shortly afterwards she began to fall into
fits, which were deemed by her friends and
neighbors to have something diabolical
about them. Soon the same complaint attacked
also her sister and her two brothers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
and the terrified observers reported that they
were all “tormented in the same part of
their bodies at the same time, though kept in
separate apartments, and ignorant of one
another’s complaints.” They were free from
trouble at night and slept well. Their afflictions
always came on in the daytime and
in public. Their diabolical visitants were
apparently instructed in theology, and displayed
a depraved taste in literature that was
intensely scandalizing to the pious Cotton
Mather, who interested himself most deeply
in the strange affliction of the children. He
relates that they would throw the children
into a senseless condition if they but looked
on the outside of such good books as the
<i>Assembly’s Catechism</i> or Cotton’s <i>Milk for
Babes</i>, while they might read with complete
impunity <i>Oxford Jests</i>, popish or Quaker
books, or the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> The
other symptoms were yet more alarming,
physically, if not spiritually. “Sometimes
they would be deaf, then dumb, then blind,
and sometimes all these disorders together
would come upon them. Their tongues
would be drawn down their throats, then
pulled out upon their chins. Their jaws,
necks, shoulders, elbows, and all their joints
would appear to be dislocated, and they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
make most piteous outcries of burnings, of
being cut with knives, beat, etc., and the marks
of wounds were afterwards to be seen.” The
ministers of Boston and Charlestown came to
the house, and kept there a day of fasting
and prayer, with the happy result of curing
the youngest of the children. The others
continued as before; and then, the clergy
having failed, the magistrates took up the
case. The old woman whose violent tongue
had apparently had some connection with the
first outbreak of the complaint, was arrested
and thrown into prison, and charged with
witchcraft. She would neither deny or confess,
but “appeared to be disordered in mind,”
and insisted on talking Gaelic, though she
had been able to talk English before. The
physicians examined her, and reported that
she was <i lang="la">compos mentis</i>, and on their report
the poor creature was hanged—a serious blot
on the usually judicious administration of
Sir Edmund Andros; so unlike him that one
is inclined to suspect he must have been absent
from Boston when this foolish crime was
perpetrated. The children gradually recovered,
grew up, “experienced religion” in
the usual way, and never confessed to any
fault or deceit in the matter. Hutchinson
writes that he knew one of them in after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
years, who had the character of a very sober,
virtuous woman.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>As these cases may be referred to the circulation
of the record of the former marvels
and illustrious providences, so now in their
turn they became the provoking causes of
many others; for a full and particular account
of these was printed, first in Boston,
and then, almost immediately afterward, in
London, with an introduction from no less a
person than Richard Baxter. This, together
with the other relations, was circulated
throughout the colony, and led to a still
greater outbreak of the delusion.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> Men
thought about witches and talked about
witches, and very naturally soon came to
believe that all the accidents and disasters
and diseases, which they could not explain
by common natural causes, were the result
of demoniac agency.</p>

<p>The strong rule of Andros had ended in
revolution and disturbance; but, much to
their disappointment, the people had been
obliged to accept a new charter under which
the rule of the hierarchy was still restrained
by the appointment of the governor by the
crown. The leaders, astute as ever, succeeded
in securing the appointment of Sir William
Phips, an ignorant and underbred sailor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
hoping to be able to influence him easily,
and thus to continue their authority. The
lieutenant-governor was Stoughton, one of
themselves, whose narrowness of mind and
bitter prejudices made him a man upon whom
they could rely implicitly. But before the
charter arrived, the colony was thrown into
a ferment of excitement by the dreadful occurrences
at Salem village (now Danvers),
which, to the minds of the majority of the
population, indicated unquestionably that the
enemy of souls was making a most desperate
attack upon the community.</p>

<p>The trouble broke out in the family of the
minister of the village, Parris by name, who
had shortly before had serious difficulties
with some of his congregation.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> His daughter
and his niece, girls ten or eleven years
old, began to make the same complaints that
had been made by the Goodwin children in
Boston three years before. The physicians
found themselves at a loss, and hence were
quite convinced that the ailments were supernatural,
and declared that the children were
bewitched. An Indian woman named Tituba,
a servant in the house, tried some experiments
of a somewhat disgusting nature,
which she claimed would discover who the
witch was that was tormenting them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
When the girls knew what she had done,
they immediately cried out that Tituba appeared
to them, pricking and tormenting
them, and straightway fell into convulsions.
The woman, alarmed at this, confessed what
she had been doing, but stoutly maintained
that, though she knew how to find out
witches she herself was none. The condition
of the children excited much attention,
and the more they were investigated the
worse they grew, and soon several others
were seized with the same symptoms. These
all had their fits, and when in them would
accuse not only the Indian woman, but also
two old half-witted crones in the neighborhood,
one of whom was bed-ridden as well as
imbecile. The three were committed to
prison, where Tituba confessed that she was
a witch and accused the others of being her
confederates. They soon had company in
the jail, as two others, women of character
and position, Mistress Cory and Mistress
Nurse, were complained of; and when they
were brought to examination, all the children
“fell into their fits” and insisted that
the accused were tormenting them. The
women naturally denied this outrageous
charge, but in spite of their denial were
committed to prison, and with them, so great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
was the infatuation and panic, a little child
of only four years of age, who, as some of the
girls insisted, “kept biting them with her
little sharp teeth.”</p>

<p>Panic, like rumor, thrives by what it feeds
on; and from day to day new victims were
accused and committed, until the prisons
were crowded. More than a hundred women,
many of them of good character and belonging
to respectable families in Salem, Andover,
Ipswich and Billerica, were arrested, and
after an examination, usually conducted by
Parris, were thrown into the jails to await
their formal trial.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> Many of these, in order to
escape, confessed whatever they were charged
with, and generally in their confessions tried
to win favor for themselves by accusing
some one else.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> Neighborhood quarrels, old
sores, spite, envy, and jealousy added their
bitterness to the prevailing madness. It
seems incredible that any rational beings
could have been found to give credence to
the farrago of nonsense that was solemnly
sworn to; yet it was the most marvellous
tales that found the readiest credence. One
confession may be cited as a sample, to illustrate
what was the force of panic terror in
the midst of this apparently civilized community.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The examination and confession (8 Sept. 92) of
Mary Osgood, wife of Captain Osgood of Andover,
taken before John Hawthorne and other their
Majesties justices.</p>

<p>“She confesses that about 11 years ago, when she
was in a melancholy state and condition, she would
walk abroad in her orchard; and upon a certain
time she saw the appearance of a cat, at the end of
the house, which yet she thought was a real cat.
However, at that time it diverted her from praying
to God, and, instead thereof, she prayed to the
devil; about which time she made a covenant with
the devil, who, as a black man, came to her, and presented
to her a book, upon which she laid her finger,
and that left a red spot. And that upon her signing,
the devil told her he was her God, and that she
should serve and worship him, and, she believes, she
consented unto it. She says further, that about two
years agone, she was carried through the air, in company
with Deacon Frye’s wife, Ebenezer Baker’s
wife, and Goody Tyler, to Five-Mile Pond, where
she was baptized by the devil, who dipped her face
in the water and made her renounce her former
baptism, and told her that she must be his, soul
and body, forever, and that she must serve him,
which she promised to do. She says ... that
she was transported back again through the air, in
company with the forenamed persons, in the same
manner as she went, and believes she was carried
upon a pole.... She confesses she has afflicted
three persons, John Sawdy, Martha Sprague, and
Rose Foster, and that she did it by pinching her bed-clothes
and giving consent the devil should do it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
her shape, and the devil could not do without her
consent. She confesses the afflicting persons in the
court by the glance of her eye.... <i>Q.</i> Who
taught you this way of witchcraft? <i>A.</i> Satan,
and that he promised her abundance of satisfaction
and quietness in her future state, but never performed
anything; and that she has lived more
miserably and more discontented since than ever
before. She confesses further, that she herself, in
company with Goody Parker, Goody Tyler, and
Goody Dean, had a meeting at Moses Tyler’s house,
last Monday night, to afflict, and that she and
Goody Dean carried the shape of Mr. Dean, the
minister, to make persons believe that Mr. Dean
afflicted. <i>Q.</i> What hindered you from accomplishing
what you intended? <i>A.</i> The Lord would
not suffer it to be that the devil should afflict in an
innocent person’s shape.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> <i>Q.</i> Have you been at
any other witch meetings? <i>A.</i> I know nothing
thereof, as I shall answer in the presence of God
and of His people: but said that the black man
stood before her, and told her, that what she had
confessed was a lie; notwithstanding, she said that
what she had confessed was true, and thereto put
her hand. Her husband being present, was asked
if he judged his wife to be any way discomposed.
He answered that having lived with her so long
he doth not judge her to be any ways discomposed,
but has cause to believe what she has said is
true.”</p>
</div>

<p>When the new charter arrived and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
new government went into operation, the
Governor and Council appointed Commissions
of Oyer and Terminer for the trial of
witchcrafts. Their action was of more than
questionable legality, as by the charter the
power of constituting courts of justice was
reserved to the General Assembly, while the
Governor and Council had only the right of
appointing judges and commissioners in
courts thus constituted. The Court, however,
was established, and was opened at
Salem in the first week of June 1692.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
At its first session only one of the accused
was brought to trial, an old woman, Bridget
Bishop by name, who had lived on bad terms
with all her neighbors, and consequently had
no friends. She had been charged with
witchcraft twenty years before, and although
her accuser had acknowledged on his
death-bed that his accusation had been false
and malicious, the stigma of the charge had
always remained. Consequently all the
losses her neighbors had met with, in cattle,
swine, or poultry, all the accidents or unusual
sicknesses they had had, were attributed to
her spite against them, and were now
brought forward as evidence against her.
This testimony, together with the charges
made by the possessed children, who continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
to reveal new horrors from day to
day, and the confessions of other women
who to save themselves accused her, was
confirmed to the satisfaction of the Court by
the discovery of a “preternatural excrescence,”
and she was convicted and executed.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
The further trials were postponed until
the end of the month, and in the interval the
Governor and Council consulted the ministers
of the province as to the proper course
to pursue. In their reply they recommended
caution and discretion, but concluded
their advice by saying, “Nevertheless
we cannot but humbly recommend unto the
government the speedy and vigorous prosecutions
of such as have rendered themselves
obnoxious, according to the direction given
in the laws of God and the wholesome statutes
of the English nation for the detection
of witchcrafts.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>The ministers had as little doubt of the
laws of England being available for their
purpose as they had of what they considered
to be the laws of God; yet it is very doubtful
whether, at the time of Bishop’s trial and
execution, there was any law in existence
which authorized their proceedings. The
old colonial law was no longer in force;
and witchcraft not being an offence at common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
law, the only law by which their action
could be justified was the statute of James
I., which must therefore have been considered
as in force in the colony. It is probable
that the execution was utterly illegal. Before
the next cases were tried, the old colonial
statute was revived and made again
the law of the province.</p>

<p>The trials were resumed in July, and
were conducted in the same manner as in
the case of Bishop, but with even greater
harshness. In one case, that of Mrs. Nurse,
the perversion of justice was most scandalous.
The accusations were so absurd, and
her character and position so good, that the
jury brought in a verdict of not guilty. So
great, however, was the indignation of the
populace, and so serious the dissatisfaction
of the Court, that the cowardly jurors asked
permission to go out a second time, and then
brought in a verdict of guilty, which was accepted.
The poor woman, whose deafness had
prevented her hearing and answering some of
the most serious charges, was solemnly excommunicated
by Mr. Noyes, the minister of
Salem, and formally delivered over to Satan,
and, with four others, was hanged. It was
long remembered that when one of them
was told at the gallows by Noyes that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
knew she was a witch, and that she had
better confess, and not be damned as well
as hanged, she replied that he lied, that
she was no more a witch than he was a
wizard, and that, if he took away her life, God
would give him blood to drink;<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> and it was
believed in Salem that the prediction was
literally fulfilled, and that Noyes came to his
death by breaking a blood-vessel in his lungs,
and was choked with his own blood.</p>

<p>It would be needlessly revolting to relate
the details of the subsequent trials, in which
the Court, driven by the popular panic
and the prevailing religious ideas, perverted
justice and destroyed the innocent.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
Nineteen persons in all were executed, all
of whom, without exception, died professing
their innocence and forgiving their murderers,
and thus refused to save their lives by
confessing crimes which they had not committed
and could not possibly commit.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
Besides those who suffered for witchcraft,
one other, Giles Cory, was put to death with
the utmost barbarity. When arraigned for
trial he refused to plead, and was condemned
to the <i lang="fr">peine forte et dure</i>, the only
time this infamous torture was ever inflicted
in America. It consisted in placing the
contumacious person on a hard floor, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
then piling weight after weight upon him,
until he consented to plead or was crushed
to death. A nearly contemporary account
relates that when, in the death agony, the
poor wretch’s tongue protruded from his
mouth, the sheriff with his cane pushed it
in again; and local tradition and ballad told
how in his torment he cried for “more
rocks” to be heaped on him to put him out
of his misery.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> This was the last of the executions.
The Court of Oyer and Terminer sat
no more, and in the interval between its adjournment
and the opening of the sessions
of the “Supreme Standing Court,” in the
following January, time was given for consideration
and reflection.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>But it may be questioned whether consideration
and reflection would have put a stop to
the delusion without the operation of another
and more powerful cause. Thus far, the
accused persons had been generally of insignificant
position, friendless old women, or
men who had either affronted their neighbors
or, by the irregularity of their lives,
had lost the sympathy of the community.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
But with their success, the boldness or the
madness of the accusers increased; some
of the most prominent people in the colony,
distinguished in many cases by unblemished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
lives, were now charged with dealings
with the devil, and even the wife of the
Governor fell under suspicion. The community
came at last to its senses, and began
to realize that the evidence, which till then
had seemed conclusive, was not worthy of
attention. Confessions were withdrawn,
and the testimony of neighbors to good
character and life was at length regarded
as of greater weight than the ravings of
hysterical girls or the malice of private
enemies. So it came about that before long
those who were not prejudiced and committed
by the part they had played, acknowledged
that they had been condemning the
innocent and bringing blood-guiltiness upon
the land. Even Cotton Mather, who had
been largely responsible for the spread of
the delusion, was compelled to admit that
mistakes had been made, though he still
maintained that if a further investigation
had been held in the cases of many who were
set free, their guilt might have been made
apparent. Some that had served on the
juries that had condemned the victims put
forth a paper admitting their delusion and
begging pardon of God and man for their
mistake.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> The impressive story of Sewall’s
penitence, and public confession of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
fault in the South Church in Boston, is well
known; more consistent and logical was the
declaration of the stern-tempered Stoughton,
that when he sat in judgment he had the
fear of God before his eyes, and gave his
opinion according to the best of his understanding;
and, although it might appear
afterwards that he had been in error, yet he
saw no necessity for a public acknowledgment
of it.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>Parris, whose part in these acts of folly
and delusion had been the most prominent
of all, and who was strongly suspected of
having used the popular frenzy to ruin some
of his personal antagonists, was compelled
to resign his position and leave the people
whom he had so grossly misled.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> Noyes,
whose delusion had been at least sincere,
made public confession of his fault, and was
forgiven by his congregation and by the
community that had erred with him. Thus
ended one of the most painful episodes in the
early history of New England.</p>

<p>The other colonies in America were not so
entirely free from this superstition that they
should reproach the Puritans for it as a
special and peculiar product of their religious
system. There were cases in New York, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, and Virginia, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
there is no record of any one having been put
to death for the offence in those colonies. In
Pennsylvania, under the prudent instructions
of William Penn, who seems to have been
less superstitious than the Massachusetts
Quakers, the jury brought in a verdict that
the person accused was guilty of “being
suspected of being a witch,” and, fortunately,
at that time suspicion was not punishable.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>
In New York, a certain Ralf Hall
and his wife were tried in 1665, but were
acquitted, and an attempt, in 1670, to create
an excitement in Westchester over Katharine
Harrison, who had moved thither from
Connecticut, was sternly suppressed.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>
There were trials for witchcraft in Maryland
in the last quarter of the seventeenth
century; and in Virginia in 1705, thirteen
years later than the Salem trials, a witch
was ducked by order of court.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>It is hard to decide how much of all this
was panic and how much deliberate fraud and
imposture. There is no reason to suspect anything
worse than pure superstition in the
early cases in Massachusetts and Connecticut;
but the marvellous attacks of the Goodwin
children in Boston and of the Parris girls in
Salem seem to belong to a different category.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>
It is almost incredible that the girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
who played so cleverly upon the vanity and
the theological prejudices of Cotton Mather
was not fully aware of what she was doing;
and the fact that the Parris children accused
persons with whom their father had previously
had trouble, renders their delusion extremely
suspicious. The great St. Benedict
is reported to have cured a brother who was
possessed by the devil by thrashing him
soundly; and it is much to be regretted that
the Protestantism of the New Englanders
prevented their knowing and experimenting
with the saint’s specific, which, in all ages of
the world, has been admitted to be wonderfully
efficacious. It has been held by many
that the testimony at Salem was deliberately
fabricated; Hutchinson, writing at
a time when men who could remember the
trials were yet living, is strongly of that
opinion. The case does not, however, seem
as clear as that of the Goodwins; and of
them Hutchinson, as has been said, reports
that they were estimable women who had
never acknowledged any deception on their
part.</p>

<p>The phenomena of mental disease are so
strange and complicated that at the present
day men are not as ready to set everything
down to fraud as they were a hundred years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
ago. It is possible to account psychologically
for all the phenomena recorded, without
being obliged to adopt any very violent
hypothesis. Even if at the outset the children
in either case were pretending, it is
quite as conceivable that they should have
passed from pretence of nervous symptoms
to the reality, as it is to think that absolute
fraud would pass so long undetected. The
symptoms described are such as would be
recognized by any alienist to-day, and could
be duplicated out of the current medical
journals. It may also be noticed that many
of the possessed were girls just coming to
maturity, and thus of an age when the nervous
system was passing through a period of
strain.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which the panic spread
was most remarkable, and it is painful to
notice the abject terror into which the population
was thrown. Parents accused their
children, and children their parents, and, in
one case at least, a wife her husband. Some
men were tied neck and heels until they
would confess and accuse others.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> It was
a period of the most pitiful mental and
spiritual cowardice, and those that were
most directly responsible for the shameful
condition of affairs were men who, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
their learning and their position, should
have been the leaders and sustainers of the
popular conscience in soberness of mind and
charity. But the ministers of New England
had emphasized the necessity of a belief in
witchcraft as a part of the Divine revelation.
The Old Testament spoke of witches, and had
said, “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,”
while the New Testament supplied the idea
of diabolical possession; hence they argued,
with a style of argument not yet disused,
that any one who denied the existence of
witchcraft was a Sadducee and an impugner
of the truth of God’s Word. Soon the reasoning
was extended to prove that any one
who denied that the particular phenomena
under discussion were caused by witchcraft
was an enemy of religion. The ministers, as
has been said, have an unenviable prominence
in the accounts of this disastrous delusion.
They were as forward in destroying the
witches as their predecessors had been in persecuting
the Quakers. They hounded on the
judges and juries in their bloody work, they
increased the popular excitement by their
public fasts and prayers and sermons, they
insulted the victims on the scaffold. It is
no wonder that, under such leadership, the
population was excited to madness. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
only when they found their own families and
friends accused by those on whose testimony
others as innocent had been destroyed, that
they were able to recognize that the accusations
were absurd and the evidence worthless.
Yet it may be said on their behalf that they
were not really as far in advance of the majority
of their contemporaries as they imagined
they were, and it is to their credit that,
when their eyes were opened, they were
opened thoroughly and not closed again.
Cases of witchcraft now disappeared from
New England, while in other lands, where
there was the same sombre Calvinism but
less enlightenment, as in Scotland, the delusion
continued for many years.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>The theological spirit now devoted itself
to barren questions of little moment, around
which wordy battles raged and hatreds developed,
only less destructive than those in
the previous century because the divines were
no longer the rulers of the state. Religion
sank into a barren formalism, which had no
noble or time-honored forms to redeem it
from utter indifference. From this deplorable
condition it was roused by three influences
which led to a spiritual revival: the
Episcopal movement in Connecticut, the
preaching and writings of Jonathan Edwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
in western Massachusetts, and the preaching
of Whitefield. The dry bones once more lived,
and the descendants of the Puritans manifest
by their earnest activity and deep spirituality
how stout and strong was the stock from which
they have inherited many of their most precious
characteristics. They may be thankful
that the old bigotry has not returned, and
that they are now saved from all danger of
interfering with public affairs by the complete
separation of church and state.</p>

<p>Panic terror of the supernatural, whenever
it has occurred, has been a parody of the
prevailing form of religion. When the religious
ideas are at once narrow and introspective,
when the social life is poor and unsatisfying,
and when there is also a profound
ignorance of bodily and mental physiology, we
have the combined conditions for the ready
and serious development of religious panic.
Such were the circumstances of the witchcraft
delusion that followed the religious revival
due to the preaching of the Franciscan friars;
such were the circumstances in Sweden in the
seventeenth century, and in Scotland in the
eighteenth; such were the circumstances in
New England at the period we have considered.
The isolated cases which appeared in various
countries from time to time were the result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
of superstition and ignorance. That they did
not cause a panic may be attributed in some
cases to the better social condition; in others,
to the presence in the community of men of
sense and character who prevented the spread
of delusion and calmed, instead of exciting,
the minds of their fellows. It is one of the
saddest features of the Salem trials, that
though prominent men whose influence
might have been expected to be exercised on
the side of soberness, disbelieved in the reality
of the “possession” and criticised privately
the methods employed, yet they allowed
the delusion to proceed to its tragical extent
without interposing their authority to prevent
or at least to denounce it. Brattle, in his
account of the delusion, written in October
1692, mentions many by name who agreed
with him in condemning the proceedings of
the justices in Salem, and the judges of the
Court of Oyer and Terminer, but looked on
while the unfortunates were tormented into
confession and put to death at the demand
of popular frenzy.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>Though we talk of the progress that the
race has made in learning and enlightenment,
it is alarming to notice how ineradicable
are the superstitions of mankind, how
germs which men deem dead really lurk dormant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
for ages, and then develop themselves
with startling rapidity when they find the
proper menstruum. Man, like other animals,
seems to exhibit a tendency from time to
time to revert to the original type, and to
reproduce the physiognomy of long-perished
races, with their fears and their hatreds,
their low spiritual conceptions and their
dominant animal passions. It is the work
of education, of civilization, and of religion to
strive against this tendency. We can only
hope that as men have, in spite of this, made
steady progress in many directions, and have
conquered and are conquering the animal
that is in them, they may in time get
the better of all the evil legacies which their
primeval ancestors have bequeathed them.
Modern science has removed the fear of
the plague in all civilized countries and is
lessening the danger of the cholera; in like
manner, we may hope the old terrors will
also in time be swept away, and man be freed
from any danger of their recurrence.</p>

The way in which Parris conducted the investigations
may be seen from the following extracts from the examination
of Elizabeth How, May 31st, 1692:</p>

<p>“Mercy Lewis and Mary Walcot fell in a fit quickly
after the examinant came in. Mary Walcot said that
this woman the examinant had pincht her &amp; choakt
this mouth. Ann Putnam said that she had hurt her
three times.</p>

<p>What say you to this charge? Here are three that
charge you with witchcraft.</p>

<p>If it was the last moment I was to live, God knows I
am innocent of anything in this nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>Did you not take notice that now when you lookt upon
Mercy Lewis she was struck down?</p>

<p>I cannot help it.</p>

<p>You are charged here. What doe you say?</p>

<p>I am innocent of anything of this nature.</p>

<p>Is this the first time that ever you were accused?</p>

<p>Yes, Sir.</p>

<p>Do you not know that one at Ipswich hath accused
you?</p>

<p>This is the first time that ever I heard of it.</p>

<p>You say that you never heard of these folks before.</p>

<p>Mercy Lewis at length spake and charged this woman
of with hurting and pinching her.</p>

<p>And then Abigail Williams cryed she hath hurt me a
great many times, a great while &amp; she hath brought me
the book.</p>

<p>Ann Putnam had a pin stuck in her hand. What do
you say to this?</p>

<p>I cannot help it.</p>

<p>What consent have you given?</p>

<p>Mercy Warren cryed out she was prickt &amp; great prints
were seen in her arms.</p>

<p>Have you not seen some apparition?</p>

<p>No, never in all my life.</p>

<p>Those that have confessed they tell us they used images
and pins, now tell us what you have used.</p>

<p>You would not have me confess that which I know
not.</p>

<p>She lookt upon Mary Warren &amp; said Warren violently
fell down.</p>

<p>Look upon this maid viz: Mary Walcot, her back being
towards the Examinant.</p>

<p>Mary Warren and Ann Putnam said they saw this
woman upon her. Susan Sheldon saith this was the
woman that carryed her yesterday to the Pond. Sus.
Sheldon carried to the examinant in a fit &amp; was well
upon grasping her arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p>You said you never heard before of these people.</p>

<p>Not before the warrant was served upon me last Sabbath
day.</p>

<p>John Indian cryed out Oh she bites &amp; fell into a grievous
fit &amp; so carried to her in his fit, &amp; was well upon her
grasping him.</p>

<p>What do you say to these things? they cannot come
to you.</p>

<p>I am not able to give account of it.</p>

<p>Cannot you tell what keeps them off from your body?</p>

<p>I cannot tell, I know not what it is.</p>

<p>That is strange that you should do these things &amp; not
be able to tell how.</p>

<p>This is a true copy of the examination of Eliz. How
taken from my characters written at the time thereof.</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_87" href="#FNanchor_87" class="label">87</a> Brattle, <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Collections</i>, v. 66, 67. The
case of Elizabeth How, mentioned above, is a good example
of the way in which neighborhood quarrels and church
quarrels were dragged in. She had had a falling out with
a family by the name of Perley some two years before, and
they now came forward with depositions that she had bewitched
their cows so that they gave no milk, and one of
their children so that it pined away. “After this,” swears
Samuel Perley, “the abovesaid goode how had a mind
to ioyn to ipswich church thai being unsatisfied sent to
us to bring in what we had against her and when we had
declared to them what we knew thai see cause to Put a
stop to her coming into the church. Within a few dais
after I had a cow wel in the morning as far as we knew
this cow was taken strangli runing about like a mad
thing a litle while and then run into a great Pon and
drowned herself and as sone as she was dead mi sons
and miself towed her to the shore, and she stunk so that
we had much a doe to flea her.”</p>

<p>The ministers of Rowley investigated the case of the
Perley child, and were evidently convinced that the
parents had put the idea into the child’s head, and gave
plain testimony to that effect, and several neighbors
came forward with testimony to the prisoner’s good
character. But a fresh collection of marvels was adduced
by a family of the name of Comins or Cummins
who accused her of bewitching their horses, and other
neighbors, not to be outdone, testified to other strange
occurrences, and the court condemned her and she was
executed on the sixteenth of July. She was, however,
only convicted upon the evidence obtained in Parris’s
investigation, though the testimony of her Ipswich
neighbors undoubtedly had great weight with the jury.
The other trials are of much the same character, some
revealing a most fiendish animosity on the part of neighbors
or relatives, and leaving a very painful impression
of the condition of country life in New England at that
time. For testimony as to the cowardice of friends and
neighbors and the confessions extorted from weak-minded
persons, see letter of Francis Dane, Sen.; Woodward,

persons suspected for witches, and condemned three.
The evidence against these was the same as formerly, so
the Warrant for their Execution was sent, and the <i>Graves

had been condemned at <i>Salem</i> formerly, but were Repreived
by the Governour.</p>

<p>In the beginning of <i>February</i>, 1693, the Court sate at

<span class="subhead">SIR EDMUND ANDROS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> casual reader of the usual American
histories will receive from them an impression
that Sir Edmund Andros was a merciless
tyrant, whose administration was only redeemed
from being utterly disastrous by its
imbecility. Even Doyle in his first volume
of <i>The English in America</i> describes him as
a wretched “placeman,” though in his later
volumes he somewhat modifies this unfavorable
criticism and describes him as respectable
but stupid. Yet the fact remains,
that the authorities in England held him
sufficiently in esteem to send him to New
York as lieutenant-governor under the Duke
of York, and to New England as governor
and captain-general of the united Dominion,
which included New York and New Jersey
as well as New England proper; and after a
complete revolution in politics in England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Andros was the man selected for the best
position in the gift of the Board of Trade
and Plantations, the governorship of Virginia.
A man who had served the Stuarts
well and faithfully, even incurring the odium
which naturally attached to the agents of
their unpopular measures, must have exhibited
something more than dull stupidity, to
recommend him to the officials of the Revolution.
The career of a public servant under
so many administrations must, at any rate,
be of interest to all students of American
history.</p>

<p>It is the unfortunate fate of many excellent
and useful officials, that, in the performance
of their duty to the state, they are
obliged to render themselves personally unpopular.
It may freely be admitted that the
British crown was generally unfortunate in
the selection of its representatives in the
American colonies; but, by a strange injustice
of history, many of the utterly bad ones
have had their faults forgotten or condoned,
while one of the most able and efficient of
them all, in spite of the careful and scholarly
works in which his character has been vindicated,
remains pilloried in the popular
histories of the American colonies as a tyrant
and oppressor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>The caustic pens of the Mathers and the
bitter spite of the early New England historians
have drawn for us an Andros whose
haughty and vindictive face rises before the
mind whenever the name is mentioned.
Local patriotism in Connecticut has created
a series of poetical myths in regard to his
administration, which tend to obscure the
sober truth of history. New York has more
grateful memories of the governor who
secured and extended her dominion and by
his wise and steady policy protected her from
her most dangerous foes. Virginia is less
grateful as yet, the unfortunate quarrel of
Andros with the clergy sufficing to obscure
the many material benefits conferred on
clergy and laity alike by his wise administration.
It is a curious fact, that both in
Virginia and in New England Andros failed
to please the ecclesiastics, different as they
were; but, by those who are not prejudiced in
favor of spiritual domination, this will hardly
be considered as a reproach.</p>

<p>The true reason of the hatred of Andros
in New England, and of his failure for so
long to obtain justice in New York, was that
he was the agent appointed to carry out the
plan of uniting the scattered and discordant
colonies into one strong Dominion. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
separatist spirit of those who preferred their
petty local privileges to the benefits of the
union, that spirit which has been so dangerous
to the country throughout the whole
course of its history, was at that time successful,
owing to the entirely disconnected
circumstance that the consolidation was
urged by the ministers of a king who was
misgoverning his people in England. In
carrying out these measures, the letter of the
law seemed to the colonists to be strained to
the utmost as against what they considered
their popular rights, and the fate of corporations
in England alarmed the similar chartered
bodies in America. James II., by his
foolish and wicked projects in England, discredited
his really statesmanlike object in
America; the union, so desirable in itself,
was discredited by the methods used to effect
it, and the narrow theory of colonial integrity
and independence survived to plague the
descendants of the men who maintained it.
It is important always to discriminate
between the object sought and the means
used to effect it. Had the consolidation been
successful, James would be looked back upon
as a public benefactor, and the motto from
Claudian upon the seal of the Dominion,
“<i>Nunquam libertas gratior exstat</i>” which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
reads like a mockery, would have been as
dear to a united people as the “<i>E pluribus
unum</i>” which they afterwards adopted.</p>

<p>New England historians have always
found it difficult to admit that there could
be any good in a man who adhered to the
fortunes of the Stuarts, or who worshipped
in the church over which Laud had been
primate. But the time that has elapsed
since the period of struggle should have
mitigated, if not utterly extinguished, the
ancestral hostility of Puritan and Prelatist.
Men are learning (under the influence of
commemorative festivities) to revise their
opinions in regard to the harshness and unloveliness
of the Fathers of New England;
and it is to be hoped that, before long, justice
may be done to the honesty of conviction
and conscientiousness of purpose that inspired
those who have been so long described
as “malignants.” Is it too much to hope
that men will be able to see that the Englishmen
who charged with Rupert, and the Englishmen
who prayed and smote with Oliver,
were both contending for a principle which
was dearer to them than life—the principle
of stern resistance to the violation of constitutional
law? If we honor the men who hated
the arbitrary government of the Stuarts, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
unfair to condemn those who hated the far
more arbitrary government of the Rump and
the Protector.</p>

<p>Edmund Andros was born in London,
December 6, 1637, of a family that was
eminent among the adherents of Charles I.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
His father, Amias Andros, was the head of
the family; he possessed an estate upon the
island of Guernsey, and was royal bailiff
of that island. His mother was Elizabeth
Stone, whose brother, Sir Robert Stone, was
cup-bearer to the unfortunate Elizabeth the
dispossessed Queen of Bohemia and Electress
Palatine, and was also captain of a troop of
horse in Holland.</p>

<p>At the time of Edmund’s birth, his father
was marshal of ceremonies to the king;<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
and the boy was brought up in the royal
household, very possibly on terms of intimacy
with the young princes whom he afterwards
served, who were only slightly his seniors.
For a time he is said to have been a page at
court; but if this be true, it must have been
when he was extremely young, as court life
ceased to have charms, if not absolutely to
exist, after the civil war broke out in 1642,
and at this time the boy was but five years old.</p>

<p>Faithful to the fortunes of his masters in
discouragement and defeat, we find the lad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
in Guernsey with his father, defending Castle
Cornet manfully against the Parliament,
and, after its surrender, receiving his first
lessons in the field in Holland under Prince
Henry of Nassau. (It is a curious fact, trifling
in appearance, but possibly not without
significance, that during the last year of the
Commonwealth, and at the time of the restoration,
Increase Mather was chaplain of
some of the troops in Guernsey, and may
have, even at that early date, formed the
bitter prejudice that is so evident in his later
actions.)<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> The services of the Andros family
were so conspicuous in this period of trial
and discouragement, that Edmund with his
father and his uncle were specially exempted
by name from a general pardon that was
issued to the people of Guernsey by Charles
II. on his restoration, on the ground that
they “have, to their great honor, during
the late rebellion, continued inviolably faithful
to his majesty, and consequently have no
need to be included in this general pardon.”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>The young soldier, who found himself restored
to home and safety at the age of
twenty-three, had passed a stormy youth;
his natural boyish loyalty had been strengthened
by what he had suffered on account of
it. He had seen those whom he most respected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
and revered dethroned and exiled,
living as pensioners on the grudging bounty
of inhospitable princes. He had seen the
legal government of England subverted by
force of arms by men whose professions of
their respect for law were never louder than
when they were overthrowing it, and had
seen England ground down under the harsh
rule of a military despotism. He had seen the
orderly and regular services of the Church of
England proscribed, its ministers turned out
of their parishes to make room, not only for
severe Presbyterians and iconoclastic Independents,
but for ranting sectaries who
made the name of religion a by-word and a
mockery. It cannot be wondered that the
young cavalier grew up deeply impressed
with the horrors of rebellion and usurped
authority, and with the conviction that much
might be sacrificed for the sake of lawful
and regular government, or that, being as
he was a member of the church that had
been proscribed and persecuted during the
reign of the self-styled “godly,” he should
have been rendered all the warmer in his attachment
to her orderly and decent rights
and ceremonies, as by law established.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the severity
shown to the Dissenters at the Restoration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
came largely from their close association with
the civil war and the government of the
Commonwealth. The cloak of religion had
been made to cover the overthrow of the liberties
of Parliament, the killing of the king,
and the rule of Cromwell; and it is not unnatural,
though most regrettable, that the
victorious cavaliers should have failed to
make the proper distinction between dissent
and rebellion.</p>

<p>A knowledge of these early conditions of
the life of Andros is necessary for a comprehension
of his character. They show the
influences which tended to form in him his
most notable characteristics: loyalty to his
sovereign, a passion for regularity and legal
methods in the management of affairs, and a
zeal for the Church of England. The promotion
of the young soldier followed quickly, as
he continued to display the fidelity and capacity
of which his boyhood had given promise.
His uncle’s position in the household of the
Queen of Bohemia determined the direction
of his promotion, and the nephew was made
gentleman-in-ordinary in the same household
in 1660, a position more honorable than
remunerative, which was soon terminated by
her death in 1662. His military training was
developed by the war with the Dutch, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
which he won further distinction and made
his first acquaintance with America and
American affairs.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> The position he had held
in the court of the exiled queen won him a
wife in 1671, in the person of a young kinswoman
of the Earl of Craven, who had been
the devoted servant, if not the husband, of
Elizabeth.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> This Lord Craven was the one
officer of the army who remained faithful to
James II. to the last, and, though eighty
years old, put himself at the head of his regiment
of body-guards to defend the king from
insult, when William of Orange was already
in London.</p>

<p>The court positions held by Andros in the
reign of Charles II. are not those of a brilliant
young cavalier, or a roystering blade
of the Restoration who only cared for place
and plunder, wine and women; they indicate
rather that passionate devotion to the house
of Stuart, which the most worthless of that
line were always able to inspire, devotion
generally recompensed by gross ingratitude.
His marriage was evidently, from the prominence
Andros himself gives to it, a high connection
for a simple country gentleman to
make, but it did not have the effect of detaching
him from a soldier’s life; for in the
same year he appears still as major of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
regiment that had been in Barbadoes, and
even at that time he had obtained the reputation
of being well versed in American
affairs.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>When this regiment was disbanded, Major
Andros received a new commission in a dragoon
regiment that was raised at that time
for Prince Rupert, in which his four companies
were incorporated, the first English
regiment ever armed with a bayonet.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> This
was the period when the proprietors of Carolina
were drawing up their remarkable
feudal constitution and dividing up lands
and titles among themselves. Lord Craven,
who was one of the proprietors, seeing the
interest that Andros took in American affairs,
procured him a patent conferring upon
him the title and dignity of a margrave,
together with four baronies containing some
forty-eight thousand acres, to support the
title. This gift, however, was only valuable
as a token of his friend’s esteem.</p>

<p>At his father’s death in 1674, he succeeded
him in his seigniory of Sausmarez and in
the office of bailiff of Guernsey.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> He was
not, however, fated to dwell in quiet and
cultivate his father’s acres; for at the end
of the second Dutch war, when his regiment
was mustered out of service, he was selected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
probably on account of his familiarity with
colonial affairs, to receive the surrender of
New York and its dependencies, in accordance
with the treaty of peace. The territory
thus recovered had been granted by Charles
II., at the time of its first seizure in 1664, to
his brother, the Duke of York; and Andros,
who must have been personally known to
them both, was now appointed lieutenant-governor
of the palatine province. His
commission bears date of July 1, 1674.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>
He was well fitted for the position. His
residence in Holland had made him familiar
with the people with whom he was chiefly to
deal, and his acquaintance with American
affairs stood him in good stead in matters
of general policy, as his administration soon
disclosed; while his connection with the court
and with the royal family enabled him to act
as a confidential agent of the Duke. He arrived
in New York in November accompanied
by his wife, and after some formalities entered
upon his government. His treatment of the
conquered Dutch was marked with great
tact and judgment, and rarely has the transfer
of a colony of one nation to the rule of
another been effected with so little friction
or disturbance.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>In regard to the serious problem of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
treatment of the Indians he was far-sighted
enough to continue the wise and judicious
policy of his predecessors in regard to the
powerful and dangerous confederation of the
Iroquois or Five Nations. The importance of
this can hardly be over-estimated in its bearing
upon the subsequent history of the country.
It is true that this policy was not original with
him; he took it as a legacy from the Dutch
in 1674, as Nicolls had done ten years before;
but it may be said that the honest and judicious
administration of Indian affairs did
much to save the English colonies from being
wiped out of existence by a general Indian
war.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> If the Iroquois had been roused to go
on the war-path, as were the unfortunate
Indians of New England, it is hard to see
what could have saved the scattered settlements.
And again, if Andros, by a tortuous
and deceitful policy like that of the United
Colonies towards the New England Indians,
had thrown the Iroquois into the arms of the
French, who were only too anxious for reconciliation
with them, there is little probability
that the valor of Wolfe would ever have had
a chance for success on the Plains of Abraham.</p>

<p>As a provincial governor Andros made
many enemies; but they were mainly in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
colonies lying adjacent to his own. The
patent of New York was very extensive, and
covered territory which the neighboring
colonies claimed had been already ceded to
them.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> Connecticut had vague claims all the
way to the South Sea, and had been devoting
its energies during the short space of its history
to edging along its frontier further and
further to the westward, in spite of the indignant
protests of the Dutch. Settlements
had been formed on Long Island, which was
undoubtedly beyond its limits. Now, the
dispute was between rival colonies of the
same country; and considering the uncertainty
of the title of Connecticut, Andros
must be allowed to have acted with propriety
and moderation. He succeeded in making
good the title of the Duke to Long Island
and Fisher’s Island, where the Connecticut
authorities were attempting to exercise jurisdiction;
but the boundary line upon the
mainland remained an unsettled question
even down to our own times. At Saybrook,
Andros did his duty in asserting formally his
principal’s claim, but was wise enough not
to press a question which would have caused
great difficulties between the Colonies.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>With the New Jersey settlers he had still
more difficulty, as they had various grants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
and patents from the Duke himself to plead
for their justification; but he pursued a
straightforward course, standing up, as he
was bound to do, for the rights of his principal,
unless they could be legally shown to
have been granted away. His passion for
regular and orderly business methods soon
manifested itself, and his letters reveal the
indignation of a man of affairs at the utterly
unbusiness-like ways of the people with whom
he had to do.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>Besides his commission as Governor of New
York, he had undoubtedly private instructions
as to how he should comport himself
towards his uneasy neighbors, the New England
colonies. He was anxious to keep on
good terms with Connecticut, as New York
was largely dependent upon that colony for
provisions; and his letters to the Connecticut
authorities are mostly of a friendly character,
though written in a tone of superiority which
undoubtedly gave serious offence. On hearing
that the people of Hartford were harboring
one of the regicides, he addressed a very
sharp letter to the colonial authorities, to
which they replied in a tone of injured innocence,
which is quite edifying, asking him
for the names of those who had so maligned
their loyalty.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<p>It was impossible for the Connecticut
Republicans to realize the profound horror
which the execution of Charles had caused,
and the depth of the feeling of hatred and
repugnance which the perpetrators of that
audacious act had inspired. Even after
William and Mary were on the throne, and
James II. was an exile, it was found that a
regicide, of the character and position of
Ludlow, dared not show himself in England;
and during the Restoration period the feeling
was intense. The act was regarded by the
majority of Englishmen as sacrilege, as well
as murder, for it had destroyed not only what
was called the sacred majesty of the king,
but the sacred majesty of the legal government.
To Andros the news that Goffe and
Whalley were escaping justice by the connivance
of the authorities was horrible, and
must have suggested doubts, if he had not
found them already, of the policy of allowing
men who would have been excluded from
all office in England to rule the king’s colonies
in America.</p>

<p>A more serious difficulty arose with Massachusetts,
whose authorities had ventured to
send commissioners to the Mohawks to treat
directly with them as an independent nation—an
act at utter variance with the policy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
the Dutch and English, who regarded them
as under their authority, and which, therefore,
was liable to plunge the colony in war.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>
The ostentatious assumption of independence
by the colony of Massachusetts, its claim to be
free from the laws of England, and the spirit
displayed by many of its leaders, which must
have seemed seditious to the legal mind of
Andros, made it necessary for him to watch
very carefully any affairs in which they were
concerned. His attitude brought upon him
the hostility of the colony, and its authorities
asserted, and constantly reiterated, the
charge that it was at Albany, by his connivance,
that Philip’s Indians had procured supplies
of arms.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>This charge, naturally, was most offensive
to the loyal spirit of Andros, who had fretted
a good deal under his forced inactivity in the
war; and he repeatedly denied it, challenging
his accusers for proof of their assertions,
proof which they were absolutely unable to
supply. They continued, however, to insinuate
this malicious statement, and it was long
believed by the people of Massachusetts, and
led undoubtedly to much of the hostility
between them and Andros during his subsequent
rule in New England.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> In spite of
their aspersions, he continued steadily in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
prudent policy, keeping the Mohawks quiet on
one side, and, by vigorous measures against
the Indians in Maine, protecting his personal
enemies from inroads upon the other.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
His government of New York was successful;
the country remained in peace; its quiet
contrasted strongly with the troubles in New
England, and the revenues of the colony
were honestly collected and wisely administered.
To those who hold the commonly received
opinion of Andros, it will seem strange
to find that he urged upon the Duke of York
the desirability of allowing the colonists
the privileges of a representative assembly.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>
In November 1677, he returned to England
on a leave of absence, remaining there until
May of the following year.</p>

<p>While in England he received the honor of
knighthood, a sign that his labors were appreciated,
and gave, in the form of answers
to the inquiries of the Committee for Trade
and Plantations, statements in regard to
American affairs which are of great value
as exhibiting the condition of the colonies,
and especially of New York, at that time.
His replies about New England are such as
we might expect from a man of his character
and position, and disclose no hostility.</p>

<p>He says: “The acts of trade and navigacon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
are sayed, &amp; is generally beleeved, not to be
observed in ye Collonyes as they ought”—a
statement which is certainly moderate if
not grammatical; and also: “I doe not find
but the generality of the Magistrates and
people are well affected to ye king and kingdome,
but most, knowing noe governmt then
their owne, think it best, and are wedded
and oppiniate for it. And ye magistrates
&amp; others in place, chosen by the people, think
that they are oblidged to assert &amp; maintain
sd Government all they cann, and are Church
members, and like so to be, chosen, and to
continue without any considerable alteracon
and change there, and depend upon the people
to justifie them in their actings.” For a description
of a puritan republic by a royalist
and churchman, this is remarkably fair and
correct.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>The last two years of his government in
New York were vexed with difficulties with
some of the English merchants of the province,
who were probably pinched by Andros’s
strict and methodical, and possibly also narrow
and literal, administration of the revenue
laws. He was openly accused by them, and
by other discontented parties, to the Duke of
York as dishonest in his management of the
revenue, and was summoned home to answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
to the charges. A special commissioner, who
was absurdly incompetent for the position,
was sent to investigate the accounts,
and he took the side of the merchants in his
report.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> Andros, however, was able to
answer satisfactorily every charge against
him, and boldly demanded a thorough examination
of all his acts as governor. He
was examined before Churchill and Jeffreys,
neither of whom would have been likely at
that time to have let any one go free who
had defrauded the Duke, and they reported
that Andros “had not misbehaved himself,
or broken the trust reposed in him by his
royal highness in the administration of his
government, nor doth it appear that he hath
anyway defrauded or mismanaged his revenue.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>Though completely exonerated, he was
not at this time reinstated in the governorship,
and the next five years of his life were
passed in England at court, where he obtained
an honorable position in the household,
and in his estates in Guernsey, to
which in 1684 the island of Alderney was
added by royal grant at a rent of thirteen
shillings.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> In 1685 he received a military
command once more, and served in the campaign
in the west of England against Monmouth;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
and the silence of the enemies in regard
to any acts of cruelty at this time is a
high tribute, for, if they had known of any,
they would undoubtedly have held him up
for abhorrence as a persecutor.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Later in
the year he was made lieutenant-colonel of
the Princess Anne of Denmark’s regiment of
horse, under the command of the Earl of
Scarsdale.</p>

<p>The accession of James, under whom he
had acted previously, made it likely that
Andros would again receive employment.
In spite of the fact that he was a devoted adherent
of the Church of England, the king,
who was attempting to restore the Roman
worship, gave him his full confidence, and
entrusted him with the work of carrying
out a project which had been for some time
before the minds of the colonial authorities
in England—the consolidation of New England
into a single province. This was no
new idea of James II., but had been discussed
for several years; and it was a plan that had
much to recommend it.</p>

<p>As early as 1678, the Lords of Trade and
Plantations had been brought to see the need
of a general governor and a fit judicature
in the colonies, for the determining of differences;
and in 1681 Culpepper had urged the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
project. A preliminary measure had been
adopted of appointing a general revenue officer
for all the American colonies, with the power
of selecting his own subordinates.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> The notorious
Randolph, a man of strict honesty and
probity of life, but unable to see more than
his own side of any question, was appointed
deputy surveyor-general over the New England
colonies, and devoted his energies to obtaining
the forfeiture of the patent of Massachusetts.
The astuteness and bribery of the
Massachusetts agents were able to defer the
evil day until the autumn of 1684, when the
charter was vacated.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> This left Massachusetts
in the hands of the crown; the next
problem was to obtain the vacating of the
more regular charters of Connecticut and
Rhode Island. Writs of <i lang="la">quo warranto</i> were
issued, and sent to the colonies respectively;
and the submission of Rhode Island, after
some decent protests, was obtained.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>Andros was chosen by the king for the important
post of governor-general, not, as
Palfrey insinuates, because he was peculiarly
disagreeable to Massachusetts, and so likely
to carry out the objects of the king; but because
the king knew him personally, and
knew him to be a man of capacity and integrity.
It is absurd to suppose that James,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
who was an experienced man of business
himself, and more familiar with colonial
affairs than any king of England before or
since, would have intentionally selected a
man for the purpose who would endanger
the success of the undertaking. Colonel
Kirke, who had been actually designated as
governor, had been withdrawn as disagreeable
to New England. It is unnecessary
here to enter into any arguments to show the
advantage that would have accrued to the
colonies if this judicious plan had been successful.
New England might have been
spared much wasteful legislation and ruinous
financial experiments, and would have
been joined together in one strong province,
instead of being composed of several weak
and jealous colonies; the union, the benefits
of which it took the colonists so long to learn,
would have been facilitated; and a strong and
united front would have been presented to
the French, who were beginning now to
threaten the existence of the English colonies.
The Stuarts, it is true, were pensioners and
allies of the King of France in Europe, but
in America they were his natural and inevitable
enemies; and James, who, unlike his
brother, felt deeply the shame of his vassalage
to the French, was anxious to prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
any extension of French power in
America.</p>

<p>Andros arrived in Boston in December
1686, and was received in a most loyal and
even enthusiastic manner.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> A large portion
of the Massachusetts people had grown weary
of the rule of the oligarchy, and Andros was
welcomed as bringing with him the protection
of English law. His government had
been constituted in detail in his commission,
and he at once proceeded to organize it and
to levy the taxes necessary for its support.
Deprived of the representative assembly in
which the semblance of free government had
been preserved, one of the towns attempted
to resist the tax. The leaders of the movement
were tried fairly and legally, and were
fined and imprisoned for their attempt at resistance.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>
After this no attempts were made
to dispute the laws of the new government, until
the revolution which overthrew all legal
authority in the colony broke out in 1689.</p>

<p>It was very important for Andros that the
submission of Connecticut should be obtained
without conflict, as Massachusetts, like New
York, was largely dependent upon the neighboring
colony for food. The Connecticut
authorities fenced and parried, interposed delays,
and showed themselves, as they always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
did, clever men of business, exhibiting qualities
that doubtless raised Governor Treat
and Secretary Allyn in Governor Andros’s
estimation. Finally, however, when further
resistance was dangerous, a letter was sent
which could be construed either as a surrender
or as not a surrender, so that they might
have a safe retreat in any case; and on the
strength of this letter Andros assumed the
government.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> The period that follows is
sometimes described as the “usurpation,”
but there is nothing in the history of the
times to give one the impression that the
government of Andros in Connecticut was
not as regular and legal a government as
the colony ever had. If Andros had not been
overthrown in Massachusetts by a carefully-prepared
rebellion, which left the colonies
without a governor, it is not likely that
either Connecticut or Rhode Island would
have ventured to resume its charter. Andros
came to Connecticut in October 1687, travelling
by way of Providence and New London,
and from New London across country
through what are now Salem, Colchester, and
Glastonbury, to the Rocky Hill ferry. He
was attended by a “company of gentlemen
and grenadiers to the number of sixty or upwards,”
and was met at the ferry by a troop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
of horse “which conducted him honorably
from the ferry through Waterfield (Wethersfield)
up to Hartford.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> Of the transactions
at Hartford we have the dramatic story of
local tradition, the only proof of which was
the existence of an oak tree said to have been
the receptacle of the charter. For this
romantic story there is absolutely no contemporary
authority, and the details are very
improbable. The charter very possibly may
have been concealed, and very possibly in the
Charter Oak, but the incidents of the familiar
story are, if known, not mentioned by
any writers of the time.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> The records of the
colony contain simply the formal but expressive
entry: “His Excellency, S<sup>r</sup> Edmund
Andross, Kn<sup>t</sup>., Capt. General &amp; Gov<sup>r</sup> of his
Ma<sup>ties</sup> Territorie and Dominion in New England,
by order from his Ma<sup>tie</sup> James the second,
King of England, Scotland, France &amp;
Ireland, the 31 of October, 1687, took into his
hands the government of this colony of Conecticott,
it being by his Ma<sup>tie</sup> annexed to
Massachusets &amp; other colonys under his Excelencies
Goverment. FINIS.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>Bulkeley, in the “<i>Will and Doom</i>,” relates
that Andros was met at Hartford by
the trained bands of divers towns who united
to pay him their respects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Being arrived at Hartford,” he continues, “he
is greeted and caressed by the Gov<sup>r</sup> and assistants,
and some say, though I will not confidently assert
it, that the Gov<sup>r</sup> and one of his assistants did declare
to him the vote of the Gen<sup>l</sup> Court for their
submission to him. However, after some treaty
between his Excellency and them that evening, he
was, the next morning, waited on and conducted
by the Gov<sup>r</sup>, Deputy Gov<sup>r</sup>, Assistants and Deputies,
to the Court Chamber, and by the Gov<sup>r</sup> himself
directed to the Gov<sup>r’s</sup> seat, and being there seated
(the late Gov<sup>r</sup>, Assistants and Deputys being present
&amp; the Chamber thronged as full of people
as it was capable of), His Excellency declared that
his Majesty had, <em>according to their desire</em>, given
him a commission to come and take on him the
government of Connecticut, and caused his commission
to be publicly read. That being done, his
Excellency showed that it was his Majesty’s pleasure
to make the late Gov<sup>r</sup> and Captain John Allyn
members of his council, and called upon them to
take their oaths, which they did forthwith, and all
this in that public and great assembly, <i lang="la">nemine contradicente</i>,
and only one man said that they first
desired that they might continue as they were.”</p>

<p>“After this his Excellency proceeded to erect
courts of Judicature, and constituted the said John
Allyn, Esq. &amp; Judge of the inferiour Court of Common
Pleas for the county of Hartford, and all others
who before had been assistants, &amp; dwelling in the
same County, he now made Justices of the Peace
for the said County.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>“From hence his Excellency passed through all
the rest of the countys of N. Haven, N. London and
Fairfield, settling the Government, was everywhere
chearfully and gratefully received, and erected the
King’s Courts as aforesaid, wherein those who were
before in the office of Gov<sup>r</sup>, Deputy Gov<sup>r</sup> and Assistants
were made Judges of the Pleas, or Justices
of the Peace, not one excepted nor (finally) excepting,
but accepting the same, some few others being
by his Excellency added to them in the several
Countys, not without, but by &amp; with their own
advice and approbation, and all sworn by the oaths
(of allegience and) of their respective offices, to do
equal justice to rich and poor, after the Laws &amp;
Customs of the Realm of England, and of this his
Majesty’s dominion.”</p>

<p>“The Secretary, who was well acquainted with
all the transactions of the General Court, and very
well understood their meaning and intent in all,
delivered their common seal to Sir E.&nbsp;A.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>
</div>

<p>Connecticut under Andros passed a period
of peace and quiet. Governor Treat and
secretary Allyn were made members of the
council and judges, besides being entrusted
with military commands, and everything
went on quietly. There was an evident disposition
to favor Connecticut, and every
reason why it should be favored. We hear
of no complaint against the government or
the laws. The worst hardship recorded is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
the settling of intestate property according
to English law, instead of the customs of the
colony. It is true that town meetings were
forbidden except once a year, but there were
frequent sessions of the courts held, so that
the citizens were not deprived of all the common
interests of their lives. With Allyn
the governor was on most friendly terms,
modifying several regulations at his suggestions,
and entrusting him largely with the
management of Connecticut affairs.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> To
make a proper catalogue of miseries, the
Connecticut historian, Trumbull, is obliged
to borrow and relate doleful stories from
Massachusetts, not asserting that they happened
in Connecticut, but certainly producing
that impression.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>There were many reasons why Connecticut
did not resent the government of Andros
as much as was the case in Massachusetts.
In the first place, Connecticut had had a lawful
government and a law-abiding people;
its charter had not been taken away as a
punishment, but as a political necessity; while
Massachusetts had been fighting for a system
of more than questionable legality, and in a
spirit which might well seem to the royal
officials to be seditious. Connecticut had enjoyed
a form of government in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
people had really controlled public affairs; in
Massachusetts the government had been in the
hands of an oligarchy, who resented most
bitterly their deposition from power as robbing
them of their peculiar privileges. In
Connecticut the ecclesiastical system at this
time was judicious and moderate; the radical
tendencies of the New Haven colony
had been held in check by the wiser policy
of Hartford. Persecution had never been
a feature of Connecticut religion, and its
history is not disgraced with the accounts of
frequent religious quarrels, excommunications,
and expulsions which are so familiar
to that of the neighboring colony. In
Massachusetts Andros found himself opposed
and thwarted in every way that the
angry leaders could devise; in Connecticut,
though men were attached to their self-government
and resented its loss, he was received
with respect and consideration. One
is led to suspect that, with all their pride in
their charter and love of their liberties, the
leading men of Connecticut were shrewd
enough to see the advantages that they received
from the new arrangement. They
saw the arrogance of their old rivals of the
“Bay Colony” humiliated; they had the
pleasure of seeing Hampshire county compelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
to come to Hartford to court, and
they felt themselves favored and trusted by
the governor. Besides all these considerations,
from the situation of Connecticut,
lying as it did between Massachusetts and
New York, it was much to Andros’s interest
that he should keep the colony well disposed,
and he took some trouble to do so.</p>

<p>And, after all, what do the charges of
tyranny and misgovernment amount to, even
in Massachusetts? The real <em>gravamen</em> of all
the charges is, that the charter had been taken
away, and the people of Massachusetts did
not enjoy those laws of England which they
had always claimed as their birthright. The
personal charges against Andros were so
frivolous that the colonial agents did not
dare to put their hands to them when the
case was brought to trial in England, and, by
their failure to appear, confessed that they
were false and malicious. It is not likely
that Andros was always conciliatory. That
a population of dissenting Whigs should put
difficulties in the way of public service of the
Church of England, as by law established,
must have been to Andros unendurable, and
it is absurd to represent his use of a meeting-house
in Boston for the religious services
of the national church as an instance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
malignant despotism.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> It is far from improbable
that Andros was compelled against
his will to be as civil as he was to the American
non-conformists, because his master was
trafficking with them in England. While
Increase Mather was intriguing with the
king and receiving friendly messages from
Father Petre, and while men like Alsop and
Rosewell and Penn were basking in the
favors of the court at Whitehall, a governor
of New England, even if he had wished, could
not venture upon any acts of oppression
in America.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> In fact, Andros’s actions in
insisting on the services of the English
Church in Boston may be considered among
the most creditable in his history, and exhibit
the character of the man. He risked offending
the king, and did offend the puritans, in
order to show respect to that historic church
of his nation, which king and puritan alike
desired to overthrow.</p>

<p>It is quite probable that Andros was at
times rough in his language. Without justifying
him in this, it may be pleaded that
it certainly was not an uncommon fault of
military men; and besides, there were a good
many things that must have made the use of
strong language a relief. He did not have a
very high appreciation of Indian deeds; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
few honest men to-day, legal or lay, would
differ from him. He reviled the palladium of
New England liberties, the towns; but perhaps
in this he was in advance of his age. He reorganized
the court system, established tables
of fees, and changed the method of proving
wills; but here the blame is not his; but
if any one’s, it should lie upon the king who
established the province, or the council who
passed the laws. The truth seems to be that
Andros was shocked and scandalized at the
loose, happy-go-lucky way of doing business
that had, up to this time, served the colonies;
and he labored in New England, as he had
in New York, and as he afterwards did in
Virginia, to give his province a good, efficient,
general system of administration. What
made it objectionable to the colonies was not
that it was bad, but that it was different
from what they had had. The man who
does his arithmetic upon his fingers would
count it a hardship if he were compelled to
use the much more convenient processes
known to better educated men. The case
was the same in New England. They did
not want to be improved; they had no desire
for any more efficient or regular administration
than they were accustomed to. They
preferred managing their own affairs badly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
to having them done for them, were it ever
so well. It is not difficult for us to appreciate
their discontent.</p>

<p>It is harder for us to put ourselves in
Andros’s place, and to feel with him the
disgust of an experienced and orderly administrator
at the loose and slipshod methods
that he saw everywhere; the indignation of
the loyal servant of the king at hardly concealed
disloyalty and sedition; the resentment
of a devoted member of the national Church
of England at the insults heaped upon it by
the men who had failed in their previous
attempt to destroy it.</p>

<p>Andros failed to conciliate Massachusetts.
An angel from heaven bearing King James’s
commission would have failed. A rebellion
against his power was carefully prepared,
doubtless in concert with the Whig leaders
in England; and when the news of the English
Revolution came, Massachusetts broke
out also, arrested the governor, destroyed
the government, and set up an irregular
government of its own.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> The object of
this revolution was evidently to overthrow
the Dominion of New England, and to
resume separate colonial independence before
the new English authorities had time to
communicate with Andros. There is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
reason to think that Andros would have
tried to hold the country for James. Respect
for the law was, with him, the reason
for his loyalty to the crown; and though he
was personally attached to the Stuarts and
had acted under James for many years, he
was governor of the Dominion, not for James
Stuart, but for the king of England.</p>

<p>The popular leaders were indeed afraid,
not that Andros would oppose the revolution
in England, but that he would accept it, and
be confirmed by William and Mary in the
same position he had held under James, and
that thus the hated union of the colonies
would be perpetuated. Their revolution was
only too successful. They had their own
way, and the events in Salem in 1692 were
a commentary on the benefits of colonial
autonomy.</p>

<p>In Rhode Island and Connecticut the old
charters were reassumed. In Connecticut,
as there had been little break when Andros
came, so now there was little trouble when
he departed. Secretary Allyn had managed
the affairs of the colony before the “usurpation”;
Secretary Allyn had been the chief
intermediary between Andros and the people;
Secretary Allyn continued to manage Connecticut
affairs after Andros had gone. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
particularists succeeded in getting possession
of the government, in spite of the opposition
of a strong minority, and Connecticut, like
Massachusetts, returned to her insignificant
but precious independence.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>Andros succeeded in escaping once, but
was arrested in Rhode Island, and returned
by the magistrates there to the revolutionary
leaders in Boston. By these he was kept in
prison for nearly a year, and then sent to
England, where, as has been said, no one
appeared against him.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> Hutchinson complains
that the Massachusetts agents were
misled by their counsel, Sir John Somers.
When one considers that Somers was one of
the greatest lawyers the bar of England has
ever known, one is inclined to believe that he
knew his clients’ case was too bad to take
into court.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>The government of William and Mary
found nothing to condemn in Andros’s conduct,
and showed their appreciation of his
services by sending him out, in 1692, as governor
of Virginia, adjoining to the office at
the same time the governorship of Maryland.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>He exhibited here the same qualities that
had characterized his government in New
York and New England; intelligent aptitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
for business, love of regularity and order,
zeal for honest administration, and consequently
some degree of severity upon offenders
against the navigation laws who were
often men of good birth and position, and last,
though not least, a great dislike of the interference
of meddling ecclesiastics with matters
of state. He reduced the records of the province
to order, finding that they had been
seriously neglected; and when the State
House was burned, he provided a building
for them, and had them again carefully
sorted and registered. He encouraged the
introduction of manufactures and the planting
of cotton, and established a legal size for
the tobacco cask, an act which protected the
merchants from arbitrary plundering by
custom house officials in England, but which
was used by his enemies to form the basis
of an accusation of defrauding the revenue.
He was on the best of terms with the prominent
men of the Dominion, and he left behind
him a pleasant memory in Virginia
among the laity, and among those of the
clergy who were not under the influence of
Commissary Blair. The quarrel with Blair
was an unfortunate one, for, though meddlesome
and dogmatic, he was working for the
higher interests of the colony; but the evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
he himself supplies of the temper of
his proceedings explains Sir Edmund’s antipathy.</p>

<p>He was recalled to England in 1698, and
was worsted in his contest with Blair, having
been unfortunate enough to bring upon himself
the resentment of the Bishop of London.
The record of the trial is preserved at Lambeth,
and has been printed in this country,
and a perusal of it will convince most readers
that Sir Edmund received very hard usage,
and might have complained, in the words of
the lawyer who was defeated in a contest
with Laud, that he had been “choked by a
pair of lawn-sleeves.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p>The rest of his life was passed at home.
The government still showed their confidence
in him by appointing him the Governor of
Guernsey.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> He lived quietly, passing a
peaceful old age, and died in February, 1714
at the age of seventy-six. His continued
interest in the welfare of the colonies, in the
service of which he had passed so many years,
is evidenced by the fact that his name appears
among the members of the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>Removed from the prejudices of his own
day and generation, and regarded in the impartial
light of history, Sir Edmund Andros<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
appears not as the cruel persecutor that he
seemed to the Mathers and the Sewalls, nor
as the envious Sanballat that Blair’s fervent
Scotch imagination pictured him, but as a
single-hearted, loyal English gentleman, of
the best type of those cavaliers, devoted to
church and king, who, in their horror at the
results of puritanism and liberalism in England,
were willing to sacrifice if necessary
some degree of personal liberty in order to
secure the dominion of law.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>Judging from what we know of him, we
should have looked to see him, had he been
in England instead of in America at the
time of the Revolution, by the side of many
fellow Tories maintaining the liberties and
the religion of his country. In America,
far from the scene of conflict, his duty was
to support the government of the king; but
the claim of the colonists that, by arresting
him, they prevented him from “making an
Ireland of America,” is disproved by his immediate
and loyal acceptance of the results
of the Revolution, and by the confidence
the new government immediately reposed in
him.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>The French authorities in Canada, who
were in a position to judge his character
correctly, have left on record their opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
that it was hopeless to expect assistance
from him against his countrymen in the
struggle between the two nations that broke
out after the abdication of James II. The
Chevalier de Callières, Governor of Montreal,
wrote to the Marquis de Seignelay as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Chevalier Andros, now Governor-General of
New England and New York, having already declared
in his letter to M. de Denonville that he
took all the Iroquois under his protection as subjects
of the crown of England, and having prevented
them returning to M. de Denonville to make peace
with us, there is no longer reason to hope for its
conclusion through the English, nor for the alienation
of the Iroquois from the close union which
exist with those (the English), in consequence of
the great advantage they derive from thence, the
like to which we cannot offer for divers reasons.</p>

<p>“Chevalier Andros is a Protestant as well as the
whole English colony, so that there is no reason to
hope that he will remain faithful to the King of
England (James II.), and we must expect that he
will not only urge the Iroquois to continue the war
against us, but that he will also add Englishmen to
them to lead them and seize the posts of Niagara,
Michillimackinac and others proper to render him
master of all the Indians, our allies, according to
the project they have long since formed, and which
they were beginning to execute when we declared
war against the Iroquois, and when we captured
seventy Englishmen who were going to take possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
of Michillimackinac, one of the most important
posts of Canada.”<a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is gratifying to notice that at last his
character and services are beginning to be
better appreciated in the provinces over
which he ruled; and we may hope that in
time the Andros of partisan history will give
place, even in the popular narratives of
colonial affairs, to the Andros that really
existed, stern and proud and uncompromising,
it is true, but honest, upright, and just;
a loyal servant of the crown, and a friend to
the best interests of the people whom he
governed.</p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_102" href="#FNanchor_102" class="label">102</a> The principal authority for the facts of Andros’s life
before he became governor of the Duke of York’s
province is a biographical sketch in the <i>History of Guernsey</i>,
by Jonathan Duncan, Esq., London, 1841, written
by the late Mr. Thomas Andros of Guernsey, who died
in 1853. This sketch was copied in <i>N.&nbsp;Y. Colonial Documents</i>,
ii. 740, and has been used by W.&nbsp;H. Whitmore in
his memoir of Sir Edmund Andros, in the first volume
of <i>The Andros Tracts</i>. Mr. Whitmore has added to the
sketch some few additional facts collected from a pedigree
at the Heralds’ Office and from private family
papers. His memoir is the most convenient, as it is the
fullest and most accurate, life of Andros that has
appeared. The <i>History of Guernsey</i>, by Ferdinand Brock
Tupper, contains a few additional facts in regard to him,
but of trifling importance. <i>Vide</i> pp. 367, 377, 392. See

From <i>Calendar of State Papers, Am. and W. Indies</i>, we
learn that Andros saw service in the West Indies, being
major in a regiment of foot, commanded by Sir Tobias
Bridge, which left England in March, 1667, and arrived
in Barbadoes in April. He returned to England in 1668,
as bearer of despatches and letters to the government,
and was in England in September of that year. Whether
he returned to Barbadoes is not evident, but he was in
England in Jan., 1671, and throughout the year. The
regiment was disbanded and four companies sent to England,
arriving there Oct. 5, 1671, and were incorporated
in the new dragoon regiment being raised for Prince
Rupert, to which Andros received his commission Sept.
14, 1671. This chronology is irreconcilable with that
given in the pedigree or by Duncan.</p>

He says (p. 392): “Edmund Andros had succeeded his
father as bailiff (<em>bailli</em>) in 1674, with power to nominate
a lieutenant during his long non-residence; he was also
a colonel of dragoons, and after his return from his
successive North American governments, he was constituted
lieutenant-governor of Guernsey by Queen Anne,
who dispensed with his executing the office of bailiff
and accepted Eleazar Le Marchant as lieutenant-bailiff.”
Apparently he had some trouble at first from the governor
of the island, Christopher, Lord Hatton, for we find
(p. 377) a royal order sustaining Andros, and forbidding
Lord Hatton to disturb him in the office of bailiff.</p>

<p>Governor Dongan’s jealousy of Andros makes his
statement of Andros’s intentions ten years before questionable
authority, especially when it is remembered that at
the time he made the statement he was busily engaged
in trying to persuade the people of Connecticut to ask
to be annexed to New York, rather than to Massachusetts
under Andros. Under these circumstances, one cannot
help suspecting his testimony as to memoranda left
behind by Andros, who was one of the most cautious and
methodical of men. <i>N.&nbsp;Y. Col. Doc.</i>, iii. 415. If Andros
intended to surprise the post, he certainly was very ill-judged
to send notice of his claim beforehand. For the

<p>Peters’s account is as follows: “They resigned it (the

Andros at Hertford, in October, 1687, and were annexed
to the Mass. Bay colony, in preference to New York, according

the very night of the surrender of it, Samuel Wadsworth
of Hertford, with the assistance of a mob, violently broke
into the apartments of Sir Edmund, regained, carried off
and hid the charter in the hollow of an elm, and in 1689,
news arriving of an insurrection and overthrow of Andros
at Boston, Robert Treat, who had been elected in
1687, was declared by the mob still to be Governor of
Connecticut. He daringly summoned his old Assembly,
who being convened, voted the charter to be valid in law,
and that it could not be vacated by any power, without
the consent of the General Assembly. They then voted,
that Samuel Wadsworth should bring forth the charter;
which he did in a solemn procession, attended by the
High Sheriff, and delivered it to the Governor. The
General Assembly voted their thanks to Wadsworth, and
twenty shillings as a reward for stealing and hiding their
charter in an elm.”</p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_150" href="#FNanchor_150" class="label">150</a> Duncan, 589. “Sir Edmund was for many years at
the head of a mixed and adventurous population, in
newly settled and important colonies, distant from the
mother country, a station at all time arduous, but immeasurably
so in the age of revolutions in which he lived,
when the institutions longest established were not exempt
from the common jeopardy, and unusual energy was
called for in all, wherever situated, by whom the royal
authority was to be asserted. He resolutely encountered
the duties and responsibilities of his high office throughout
the long course of his career, and was successful in
resisting, in his military as well as in his civil capacity,
the intrigues and hostilities of the neighboring French
and Indians, to which he was continually exposed. By
some of the chroniclers of the period, who wrote, doubtless,
not uninfluenced by its partisanship, he has been represented,
in his earlier government under James the Second,
as an abettor of tyranny; but by others of them, appearing
to have possessed the best means of judging of the
circumstances under which he acted, his conduct has
been liberally estimated. His later administration, under
William the Third, is allowed to have been irreproachable.
All the colonies advanced greatly in improvement
whilst under his charge; and the fact that he was distinguished
by the marked approval and successive appointments
of his several sovereigns, after, no less than
before, the Revolution, cannot but be interpreted as the
strongest testimonial in his favor, and highly to the honor
of his reputation.”</p>

<p>Chalmers remarks (<i>Political Annals</i>, i. 422): “The
charges of greatest magnitude were not the faults of the
governor, but of the constitution; the smaller accusations
arose from actions directly contrary to his instructions.
Did he act contrary to them and to his commission,
he had been the most faithless of servants, and most
criminal of men. But he did not. For, when the agents
of the province impeached him before William, they
accused him not of acting inconsistent with either, but
of having exercised an authority unconstitutional and
tyrannous. His conduct was approved of by James;
and he was again appointed a colonial governor by William,
because he equally appeared to him worthy of trust.
Unhappily oppressed by a real tyranny, the colonists of
those days beheld every action with diseased eyes, and
their distempers have descended in a great measure to
their historians, who have retailed political fictions as
indubitable truths.” And again: “What a spectacle does
the administration of Andros hold up to mankind for
their instruction; under a form of government, plainly
arbitrary and tyrannous, more real liberty was actually
enjoyed than under the boasted system, which appeared
so fair.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LOYALISTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> opportunity of uniting together the
colonies was lost when the government of
England, under William and Mary, condoned
the rebellion in Massachusetts, and allowed
Connecticut and Rhode Island to resume
their charters. From that time onward,
union under the royal authority was impossible,
even in the face of the pressing
dangers of the French and Indian wars, to
which for over sixty years the colonies were
almost continuously exposed. Futile attempts
were made, but in face of such a
triumph of individualism nothing could be
accomplished. When the conference at
Albany, in 1754, put forth a plan of federation,
drawn up by Benjamin Franklin and
studiously moderate in its provisions, it was
rejected with indignation by the colonies, as
tending to servitude, and by the authorities
in England, as incurably democratic.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> Yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
the attempt that had been made had, at
least, one result: it had created what we
may call an imperial party, the members of
which were devotedly attached to the connection
with Great Britain, and opposed to
that narrow spirit so prevalent in the colonies,
which esteemed nothing as of value
in comparison with their local customs and
local privileges. This party grew strong in
New York, where the extravagances of Leisler’s
insurrection had called for stern chastisement,
and was also well represented in
New England. The new charter of Massachusetts,
which gave it a governor appointed
by the crown, while preserving its Assembly
and its town organizations, had tended to
encourage and develop, even in that fierce
democracy, those elements of a conservative
party which had been called into existence
some years before by the disloyalty and tyranny
of the ecclesiastical oligarchy. Thus,
side by side with a group of men who were
constantly regretting their lost autonomy,
and looking with suspicion and prejudice at
every action of the royal authorities, there
arose this other group of those who constantly
dwelt upon, and frequently exaggerated,
the advantages they derived from their
connection with the mother country. In Connecticut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
there was a strong minority that
had opposed the re-assumption of the charter
after the overthrow of Andros; and in all
the royal provinces an official class was gradually
growing up, that was naturally imperial
rather than local in its sympathies. The
Church of England, also, had at last waked
up to a sense of the spiritual needs of its
children beyond the seas, and by means of
the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel
was sending devoted and self-sacrificing
missionaries to labor among the people of
the colonies.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> The influence of this tended
inevitably to maintain and strengthen the
feeling of national unity in those of the
colonists who came under the ministrations
of the missionaries. In the colony of
Connecticut, especial strength was given
to this movement by an unexpected religious
revolution, in which several of the
prominent ministers of the ruling congregational
body, and many of the best of the
laity, forsook their separatist principles and
returned to the historic church of the old
home.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> The wars with the French, in which
colonists fought side by side with regulars,
in a contest of national significance, tended
upon the whole to intensify the sense of imperial
unity; although there can be no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
doubt that the British officers generally, by
their contemptuous speeches and by their insolent
manner towards the colonials whom
they affected to despise, prepared the way for
the eventual rupture of sentiment between
the colonies and England.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<p>It is hardly an exaggeration to say that
neither navigation laws nor the Stamp Act
nor parliamentary interference had as much
to do in alienating the affections of Americans
from the mother country, as had the
ill-mannered impertinence of the British officers
and the royal officials. This insolence,
when joined to Grenville’s bungling and exasperating
attempt to extend imperial taxation
to the colonies, had the result of uniting
for a time nearly all Americans in opposition
to the measures proposed by the advisers of
the king, and enabled them to win a great
constitutional victory over the attempt to impose
stamp duties upon them. The division
into two distinct parties, though as has
been pointed out the groups had been gradually
forming and drawing apart from one
another, did not really come into definite existence
until the further impolitic measures
of successive ministries had strengthened
the hands of those who were traditionally
disposed to resist the authority of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<p>It is very hard for us to put ourselves in
the place of men of a century ago, and to
think their thoughts and surround ourselves
in imagination with their environment; we
naturally carry back much of the nineteenth
century into the eighteenth. We know the
America of to-day, a vigorous, healthy, prosperous,
mighty nation, reaching from sea to
sea, filled with a busy people, adorned with
the achievements of a hundred years, hallowed
by many sacred memories. The
American flag has floated proudly through
the smoke of battle in every quarter of the
world, and for a hundred years men have
seen in it the symbol of a country and a
fatherland. It is difficult for us to realize
that, before 1776, these influences had no
power; there was then no nation, no country,
no fatherland, no flag, nothing but a
number of not over-prosperous colonies, with
but little love or liking for one another.
Even the strongest Americans did not venture
to use the word <em>nation</em> or its derivatives,
but called their congress, even after
the formal separation from England, simply
the Continental Congress. The very considerations
which show us how wonderful and
even sublime were the faith and the devotion
of the leaders of the American revolution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
will also show us how natural it was, how
almost inevitable it was, that other men,
whose connection with England was closer
and more intimate, whose habits of mind
were conservative rather than progressive,
who had been brought up to fear God and
honor the king and to think more about
their duties than about their rights, should
cling with devotion to the cause of the
mother-country and condemn the revolution
as a “parricidal rebellion.”</p>

<p>Besides this highest motive, which influenced
the best and the purest-minded among
the opponents of colonial separation, there
were undoubtedly other motives of lower
character, which affected some men in their
decision, and disposed them to loyalty. The
political power of all the colonies had been
largely in the hands of those who were
known as the “better sort,” usually gentlemen
of good family, rich and well educated;
in some of the colonies official position had
been treated as the special prerogative of a
few distinguished families who contended
with one another for its possession: none of
the colonies, not even Connecticut, was democratic
as we understand the term to-day.
In some cases the revolutionary movements
and impulses came from a class which wished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
to occupy public positions from which they
had been excluded, and in others from dissatisfied
and discontented men of birth and
family, who were tired of being out in the
cold, while their rivals were enjoying the
pleasures and emoluments of office.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> Thus
in New York, the history of the revolution is
closely bound up with the family feuds of the
De Lanceys on the one side with the Livingstons
on the other. In Massachusetts, the
quarrel between Governor Bernard and the
Otises did much to increase the patriotism of
the latter family; and until the very breaking
out of hostilities, the contest within the
colony was between a majority of the well-to-do
merchants and lawyers of Boston on
the one side, and the least stable elements of
the populace, under the leadership of one of
the most skilful of political agitators, Samuel
Adams, upon the other.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that, in Massachusetts
at least, most well-to-do persons considered
the agitation at first to be merely political,
the usual device of the “outs” against the
“ins”; they laughed at the loud talk of
some of the orators, and considered that it
was put on for effect.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> When, in addition
to this, the cause of American rights was
disgraced, year after year, by riots, murder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
arson, and sedition, those who were entrusted
with the responsibilities of office, however
much they sympathized with the abstract
principles that were upheld by the popular
leaders, were prejudiced against the concrete
application of them.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> We should also remember
that, down to the time of the battle
of Bunker Hill, if not later, all parties united
in the most loyal and devoted language.
The rights that were claimed were not the
rights of Man, but of “natural-born subjects
of the king of Great Britain”; the king was
always described as “the best and most generous
of monarchs,” and separation was
never mentioned as a possibility in any public
utterance. War was looked forward to
by some of the most eager as a means of
bringing the ministry to terms, or as an unavoidable
necessity if the unconstitutional
taxation was persisted in; but, up to the very
last, most men agreed with Richard Henry
Lee, who said to Adams, as they parted after
the first Continental Congress in 1774: “All
offensive acts will be repealed—Britain will
give up her foolish project.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<p>When the most ardent American patriots
used this language, and used it sincerely, it
is not remarkable that those who formed the
opposing political party, who were conservative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
when these were the radicals, should
have felt that they were bound by their duty
to their king and country, or that they
should also have felt that the disorderly actions
and the factious attitude of some of the
extreme patriots in Massachusetts and elsewhere
were simply seditious. These convictions
were undoubtedly strengthened by the
abominable treatment which many of them
personally received. They were not apt to
look with greater favor upon a cause whose
votaries had tried to recommend it to their
liking by breaking their windows, plundering
their houses, constantly insulting them,
their wives and their daughters, to say
nothing of tarring and feathering them, or
of burning them in effigy. The penal measures
imposed by the Parliament upon the
town of Boston and the colony of Massachusetts
had been brought upon themselves by the
so-called patriots. One rather wonders at
the slowness and mildness of the British government,
and at their miserable inefficiency,
than at any repressive measures that they
undertook. They deserved to lose the colonies
for their invincible stupidity, which led
them from one blunder into another; they
irritated when they ought either to have
crushed or conciliated; they tried half-measures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
when vigorous action was necessary;
they persisted in affronting all the other colonies
while they failed in chastising sedition
in Massachusetts. The result was that they
drove many men, who were loyal subjects of
Great Britain in 1774, into revolution in
1776, while they allowed the rebels of Massachusetts
to wreak vengeance at their will
upon those who had been faithful in their
allegiance to their king.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>Besides those who were loyalists from
conviction and temperament and those who
were almost unavoidably so from the political
position they occupied, there were also men
who were loyalists from the profit it gave
them. Such were the holders of the minor
offices in the gift of the royal governors, the
rich merchants who represented English
trading-houses, and dreaded war and disturbance.
There were others whose chief desire
was to be upon the winning side, who were
unable to conceive the possibility of the defeat
of the English government by a handful of
insurgent colonists, and some also who, from
local or personal dislikes or prejudices, or
from love of opposition, took a different
side from that which was taken by their
neighbors. It is probable, however, that there
were hardly any whose motives were not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
some extent mixed; few on the one hand so
disinterested or so devoted as not to be moved
in some degree by self-interest or prejudice,
few on the other hand whose nature was so
biassed by prejudice or so sordid with love
of place or pension as not also to be moved
by the higher impulse of fidelity.</p>

<p>Loyalty is hard to define; it is one of
those virtues which appeals not so much to
the head as to the heart. Its critics accuse
it of being irrational and illogical, as being
based upon sentiment rather than upon conviction.
Yet, in spite of logic and reason,
or rather, on account of its profounder logic
and higher reason, loyalty will hold its own,
and strike an answering chord of admiration
in the human heart as long as men appreciate
disinterested virtue. It may be classed with
the other unreasoned qualities that men yet
esteem, with faith and truth, honor and
courage, decency and chastity. It may be
a man’s intellectual duty to follow the
dictates of his understanding and to act
upon his temporary convictions, whatever
pain the action cost; nevertheless, the man
whom we respect and follow is not the man
who is always changing, who is easily influenced
by argument, but the man who
abides by certain fixed principles, and refuses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
to desert them, unless it can be shown
him that beyond all chance of mistake they
are wrong and misleading.</p>

<p>It has been sometimes asserted that loyalty
can only be felt towards a personal ruler or
a dynasty; such a restriction of the term
is entirely unfounded. It is, by its very
derivation, devotion to that which is legal
and established. Legality and Loyalty are
etymologically the same. No one can doubt
that there is a high and noble devotion to
right and justice which is as admirable and
as strong as a devotion to any person. It
is a more refined sentiment and appeals to
a higher moral sense than does the simple
fidelity to a person, beautiful and touching
though such devotion be. The loyalty of men
who, like the younger Verneys, espoused the
side of the Parliament in its struggle with
Charles the First, was as true and real a
sentiment, though its character was impersonal,
as was that of the stout Sir Edmund,
who, though “he liked not the quarrel,”
followed the king, because “he had eaten his
bread too long to turn against him in his
necessity.” There could hardly be a finer example
of this loyalty to an idea than was
shown by those Americans who condemned
the stupid errors of the king and his advisers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
and realized fully the danger to liberty in
the system of government that George the
Third was attempting to carry out in England
and in America, and yet, in spite of all, remained
patriotic subjects, not from affection
but from principle, trusting to constitutional
methods to overcome the evils which they
felt as strongly as any of those who made
them a justification for revolution.</p>

<p>As has been shown, among those who
adhered to the side of the mother country
in the revolution there were men of all kinds
and convictions. There were those who
were loyal because they believed in the legal
right of the Parliament to tax the colonies,
short-sighted as the policy might be, and considered
their duty and their allegiance to be
due to the united empire. There were those
who adhered to the king’s cause from personal
devotion to him and to his dynasty, an
unreasonable devotion in the eyes of some,
but certainly not as contemptible as American
satirists have loved to describe it. There
were those who were by nature conservatives,
willing to do anything sooner than change,
governed completely by a prejudice which
hardly deserves the noble name of loyalty,
but still had in it an element of steadiness and
sturdiness that redeems it from contempt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
There were also, undoubtedly, men who calculated
the chances of victory in the struggle
and espoused the side that they thought
was likely to win; there were those who
were for the king from pure gregariousness,
because some of their friends and neighbors
were on that side; and, finally, some who,
from a mere love of opposition, set themselves
against the cause of America because
their neighbors and townsmen favored it.</p>

<p>And, as the motives which impelled men
were different, so also their actions differed
when the rupture came between the king and
the colonies. Some were active favorers of
the cause of the king, doing whatever they
could to assist it and to injure the cause of
their rebellious neighbors. Others sadly left
their homes at the outbreak of the war and
took refuge in England or in some of the
English provinces, suffering want, anxiety,
and despair, snubbed and despised by the insular
English, compelled to hear America and
Americans insulted, dragging along a miserable
existence, like that of the shades whom
Virgil found upon the bank of the infernal
river, not allowed to return to earth or to
enter either Elysium or Tartarus. Others
attempted to live in peaceful neutrality in
America, experiencing the usual fate of neutrals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
animals like the bat neither beast nor
bird but plundered and persecuted by both.
Such betook themselves usually to the protection
of the British arms, and were to be
found in the greatest numbers at or near
the headquarters of the British generals
in Savannah or Charlestown, Newport or
New York.</p>

<p>Some American writers have been extremely
severe upon the Americans who
served in the royal armies; such condemnation
is certainly illogical and unjust. They
were fighting, they might have reasoned, to
save their country from mob rule, from the
dominion of demagogues and traitors, and to
preserve to it what, until then, all had agreed
to be the greatest of blessings—the connection
with Great Britain, the privilege and honor
of being Englishmen, heirs of all the free
institutions which were embodied in the
“great and glorious constitution.”</p>

<p>If the loyalists of New York, Georgia, and
the Carolinas reasoned in this manner, we
cannot blame them, unless we are ready to
maintain the proposition that the cause of
every revolution is necessarily so sacred that
those who do not sympathize with it should
at least abstain from forcibly opposing it.
The further charge is made that the worst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
outrages of the war were committed by
Tories, and the ill-doings of Brant and Butler
at Wyoming and Cherry Valley, together
with the raids of Tryon and Arnold, are held
up to the execration of posterity as being
something exceptionally brutal and cruel, unparalleled
by any similar actions on the part
of the Whig militia or the regular forces of
either army, Sullivan’s campaign through the
Indian country being conveniently forgotten.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>
Impartial history will not palliate the
barbarities that were committed by either
party; but there can be no doubt that the Tory
wrong-doings have been grossly exaggerated,
or at least have been dwelt upon as dreadful
scenes of depravity to form a background for
the heroism and fortitude of the patriotic
party whose misdeeds are passed over very
lightly. The methods of the growth of popular
mythology have been the same in America
as elsewhere; the gods of one party have
become the devils of the other. The haze of
distance has thrown a halo around the
American leaders, softening their outlines,
obscuring their faults, while the misdeeds of
Tories and Hessians have grown with the
growth of years. But it is an undoubted
fact that there were outrages upon both sides,
brutal officers on both sides, bad treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
of prisoners on both sides, guerilla warfare
with all its evil concomitants on both sides,
and in these respects the Tories were no worse
than the Whigs. There was not much to
choose between a Cowboy and a Skinner,
very little difference between Major Ferguson’s
command and that of Marion and
Sumter. There was no more orderly or
better-behaved troop in either army than
Simcoe’s Queen’s Rangers;<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> possibly there
was none on either side as bad as the mixture
of Iroquois Indians and Tory half-breeds
who were concerned in the massacres at
Wyoming and Cherry Valley.</p>

<p>The Americans, however, do not deserve
any credit for abstaining from the use of Indian
allies. They tried very hard to make
use of them, but without success. A few
Englishmen in the Mohawk Valley, faithful
to the traditions of just and honest treatment
of the Indians, which had been inherited from
the Dutch, had succeeded in making the Iroquois
regard them as friends, but everywhere
else the Indian and the colonist were bitter
and irreconcilable foes. The savage had long
scores of hatred to pay, not upon the English
nation or English army, but upon the American
settlers who had stolen his lands, shot
his sons, and debauched his daughters. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
employment of the Mohawks by the English
was an outrage and a crying shame upon
civilization; but the responsibility of it lies
directly upon the government which allowed
it, and the commanding generals who sanctioned
the expeditions, and only indirectly
upon the men who carried out the directions
of their superiors.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> It is interesting to remember
in this connection that the courteous
and chivalrous Lafayette raised a troop of
Indians to fight the British and the Tories,
though his reputation has been saved by the
utter and almost ludicrous failure of his
attempt. The fact is that, as far as the
Americans were engaged in it, the war of
the Revolution was a civil war, in which
the two sides were not far different in numbers
or in social condition, and very much
the same in their manners and customs.
The loyalists contended all through the war
that they were in a numerical majority, and
that if they had been properly supported by
the British forces and properly treated by
the British generals, the war could have
been ended in 1777, before the French alliance
had given new hopes and new strength
to the separatist party.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>Sabine, in his well-known work on the
loyalists of the Revolution, computes that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
there were at least twenty thousand Americans
in the military service of the king at
one time or another during the war.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> Other
authorities think this estimate too high, but
the number was extremely large. In New
York and New Jersey it is probable that the
opponents of separation outnumbered the
patriot party, and the same is probably true
of the Carolinas and Georgia. Even in New
England, the nursery of the Revolution, the
number was large and so formidable, in the
opinion of the revolutionary leaders, that in
order to suppress them they established a
reign of terror and anticipated the famous
“Law of the Suspected” of the French
Revolution. An irresponsible tyranny was
established of town and country committees
at whose beck and call were the so-called
“Sons of Liberty.” To these committees
was entrusted an absolute power over the
lives and fortunes of their fellow-citizens,
and they proceeded on principles of evidence
that would have shocked and scandalized a
grand inquisitor.</p>

<p>Virginia and Maryland seem to have been
the only provinces in which the body of the
people sympathized with the projects of the
revolutionary leaders. The few loyalists
there were in Virginia retired to England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
with the last royal governor, and in Maryland
a strong sense of local independence and local
pride led the colony to act with unanimity
and moderation.</p>

<p>The rigorous measures adopted by the new
governments in the Eastern States, and the
activity of their town committees, succeeded
in either driving out their loyalist citizens or
reducing them to harmless inefficiency. In
New York and New Jersey, however, they
remained strong and active throughout the
war; and as long as the British forces held
Georgia and the Carolinas, loyalty was in
the ascendant in those states.</p>

<p>The question will naturally be asked, why,
if they were so numerous, were they not
more successful, why did they yield to popular
violence in New England and desert the
country while the contest was going on, why
did they not hold the Southern States and
keep them from joining the others in the
Continental Congresses and in the war. In
the first place, a negative attitude is necessarily
an inactive one; and in consequence of
this and of the fact that they could not take
the initiative in any action, the loyalists
were put at a disadvantage before the
much better organization of the patriotic
leaders. Though these were few in number,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
in the South they were of the best families
and of great social influence, and in the
North they were popular agitators of long experience.
They manipulated the committee
system so carefully that the colonies found
themselves, before they were aware of the
tendency of the actions of their deputies, involved
in proceedings of very questionable
legality, such as the boycotting agreement
known as the American Association, and the
other proceedings of the Continental Congress.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
When the war began, the population
of the three southernmost states had
very little care, except for their own lives
and pockets. They were, with the exception
of a few distinguished families, descendants
of a very low grade of settlers. Oglethorpe’s
philanthropy had left the legacy of disorder
and inefficiency to the colony of Georgia, a
legacy which the Empire State of the South
has now nobly and grandly outlived. North
Carolina had a most heterogeneous population,
and was, perhaps, the most barbarous
of all the colonies; while in South Carolina
the extremes in the social scale were most
strongly marked, from the high-spirited
Huguenot gentlemen to the poor whites who
formed the bulk of the population, worse
taught, worse fed, and worse clad than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
negro slaves. Such a population as this,
living also in constant fear of negro insurrection,
was not likely to count for much on
the one side or the other; and we shall find, if
we read Gates’s and Greene’s dispatches on
the one side, and Rawdon’s and Cornwallis’s
on the other, that the rival commanders
agree in one thing at least—in condemning
and despising the worthlessness of the militia
recruited in the southern country.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> It was
the utter cowardice of this militia that lost
the battle of Camden and caused the needless
sacrifice of the lives of the braver Continentals;
and the correspondence of the English
general is full of instances that prove that,
except for plundering and bushwhacking,
there was little use to be made of the loyalists
in the South.</p>

<p>As to the other questions, why, when the
loyalists were so numerous, were they not
more successful, and why did the eastern
loyalists yield to the violence that was offered
them, one question nearly answers the
other. They were not successful, because
they had no leaders of their own stock and
country, and because the British commanders
blundered throughout the war with as unerring
certainty and unfailing regularity as
the various British ministries had done from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
1764 to 1776. The game was in the hands of
the English, if they had known how to play it,
for the first three years of the war. Then
English inefficiency, rather than any belief
in the ability of the colonists to make good
their own independence, brought about the
French alliance; and the war assumed from
thenceforward a very different aspect. The
desertion of their cause and their country by
the many Tories who left New England for
Great Britain or the loyal provinces, and the
supineness of the men of place and position
who attempted to preserve an attitude of
neutrality instead of siding openly either for
or against the king, weakened the king’s
cause in America and prevented the numbers
of the loyalist population from counting for
as much as they were really worth.</p>

<p>The clever French diplomatist who collected
and translated the correspondence of Lord
George Germaine with the British generals
and admirals, a remarkably well-informed
critic of the military operations in America,
states in his Preface his opinion as follows:
“Another thing which clearly proves that
the affairs of the English have been badly
conducted in America, is that the American
loyalists alone were superior in number to
the rebels. How, then, has it come to pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
that troops double in numbers, well paid
and wanting nothing, aided besides by a
German army, have failed in opposing the
partisans of liberty, who, badly paid and
badly equipped, often lacked everything?
Manifestly it is in the different capacity of
the commanders that we must seek for the
counterweight which has turned the scale in
favor of the latter. If the English had had
a Washington at the head of their army
there would long since have been no more
question of war on the American Continent....
M. Linguet has said somewhere in
his annals that the secretaries of the Congress
were better than the secretaries of the
English generals. The same may be said of
the generals themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>Besides being inefficient in the field, the
British commanders alienated their friends
and weakened the attachment of the loyalists
to the cause of the king by their extremely
impolitic treatment of the American
provinces within their occupation. The
regular officers made no secret of their
contempt for the colonists, and plundered
them without mercy, making little, if any,
distinction between loyalist or rebel, Tory or
Whig. Judge Thomas Jones, a New Yorker
of prominence and position, who was a devoted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
loyalist and one of the number especially
singled out by name in the Act of
Confiscation and Attainder passed by his
native state, has left us his record of the
way in which the British officers and officials
exasperated rather than conciliated the
Americans, and punished rather than rewarded
the loyal for their attachment to the
king and the integrity of the empire. He
writes: “In 1780, part of the army went
into winter quarters upon the westernmost
end of the island, where they robbed,
plundered, and pillaged the inhabitants of
their cattle, hogs, sheep, poultry, and, in
short, of anything they could lay their
hands upon. It was no uncommon thing of
an afternoon to see a farmer driving a flock
of turkeys, geese, ducks, or dunghill fowls
and locking them up in his cellar for security
at night.... It was no uncommon
thing for a farmer, his wife and children
to sleep in one room, while his sheep were
bleating in the room adjoining, his hogs
grunting in the kitchen, and the cocks crowing,
hens cackling, ducks quacking, and
geese hissing in the cellar.... This robbing
was done by people sent to America
to protect loyalists against the persecutions
and depredations of rebels. To complain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
was needless; the officers shared in the
plunder.” In Newtown, a Hessian soldier
opened a butcher’s shop, where he undersold
all competitors, because while they had to
pay for their meat he had no such outlay.
In 1781, when the troops left Flushing, a
resident of that place wrote, “There was not
a four-footed animal (a few dogs excepted)
left in Flushing, nor a wooden fence.”</p>

<p>We cannot wonder at the indignant words
with which Mr. Jones closes his recital of
this vandalism. “If Great Britain had,
instead of governing by military law, by
courts of police, and courts martial, revived
the civil law, opened the courts of
justice, invested the civil magistrates with
their full power, and convened general assemblies
in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Virginia, and in
South and North Carolina (as well as in
Georgia, where it produced the most salutary
effects), as the rebels abandoned these provinces
and fled before the British arms; and
prevented, by severely punishing, all kinds
of plunder, rapine, and pillage committed
by the army, the rebellion in all probability
would have terminated in a different manner.
The empire would not have been disgraced
or dishonored, nor Great Britain reduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
to the necessity of asking pardon of her
ungrateful children, acknowledging herself
in the wrong, and granting them absolute,
unconditional independence. But, alas! the
very reverse of this marked every step in
the royal army in all its proceedings, and
Great Britain, as well as the Independent
States of America, feel to this day the dire
effects of a conduct so very impolitic, so unmilitary,
so unjustifiable, and so repugnant
to the Constitution, the spirit, the honor,
and the sentiments of Englishmen.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p>And now let us inquire how the loyalists
were treated by the new governments of the
various states. Besides the irregular violence
to which the unfortunate loyalists
were exposed at the hands of Sons of Liberty
and town committeemen, they were marked
out for punishment and plunder by the new
state governments as they came into existence.
The State of Massachusetts proscribed
three hundred and eight persons by name,
whom it condemned, if ever found within
its borders, to imprisonment and eventual
banishment; and if they ventured to return,
it denounced the death penalty upon them.
Not all of these were the wealthy merchants
and lawyers who had offended the populace
by their addresses to Hutchinson and Gage;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
at least a fifth of the number were from the
middle classes of society, and some of them
were of still humbler position. The State of
New Hampshire, small as its population was
at that time, banished seventy-six by name
and confiscated twenty-eight estates. New
York attainted and confiscated the property
of fifty-nine persons by name, three of whom
were women whose chief offence lay in the
attractiveness of their estates. Pennsylvania
summoned sixty-two persons to surrender
themselves for trial for treason, and on their
failing to appear they were pronounced
attainted, and thirty-six estates were confiscated.
In Delaware the property of forty-six
refugees was confiscated. In North Carolina,
sixty-five estates were confiscated. In South
Carolina, for the offence of attachment to
the royal cause in different degrees of offensiveness,
two hundred and fifteen persons
were either fined twelve per cent. of their
entire property, or deprived of it wholly,
or banished from the country.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> In Rhode
Island, death and confiscation of estate were
the punishments provided by law for any
person who communicated with the ministry
or their agents, afforded supplies to their
forces, or piloted the armed ships of the
king; and certain persons were pronounced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
by name enemies to liberty, and their property
forfeited in consequence. In Connecticut,
where the loyalists were very numerous
but inclined to be quiet if they were let
alone, these offences only involved loss of
estate and of liberty for a term not exceeding
three years; but to speak, write, or act
against the doings of Congress or the Assembly
of Connecticut was punishable by
disqualification from office, imprisonment,
and the disarming the offender. The estates
of those who sought the royal fleets or land
forces for shelter might, by law, be seized
and confiscated. In her treatment of loyalists
Connecticut showed the same shrewd
sense that had characterized the proceedings
of that republic from its earliest days; and
the result was seen in the fact that the
loyalists, instead of being alienated, became
after the war was over some of her best and
most patriotic citizens. William Samuel
Johnson, who during part of the war, at
least, was under surveillance as a suspected
Tory, but who when the war was over was
one of Connecticut’s delegates to the Constitutional
Convention of 1787, and Seabury,
the author of the clever and exasperating
“A.&nbsp;W. Farmer” letters, who had been
pulled through the mud by Sons of Liberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
at New Haven, were none the less loyal
citizens of the commonwealth and of the
nation, and none the less respected by men
who had differed from them, because they
had been loyal to their convictions of duty.
In Massachusetts, the feeling was much more
bitter, and, in addition to the special act
already mentioned, any person suspected of
enmity to the Whig cause might be arrested
under a magistrate’s warrant and banished,
unless he would swear fealty to the friends
of liberty; and the selectmen of towns could
prefer in town meeting charges of political
treachery and the individual thus accused, if
convicted by a jury, could be sent into the
enemy’s jurisdiction. By a second special
act the property of twenty-nine persons,
“notorious conspirators,” was confiscated;
of these, fifteen had been “mandamus” councillors;
two, governors of the province; one,
lieutenant-governor; one, treasurer; one,
secretary; one, attorney-general; one, chief-justice;
and four, commissioners of customs.
The State of Virginia, though passing no
special acts, passed a resolution that persons
of a given description should be deemed and
treated as aliens, and that their property
should be sold and the proceeds go into
the public treasury for future disposal. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
New York, the county commissioners were
authorized to apprehend and decide upon the
guilt of such inhabitants as were supposed to
hold correspondence with the enemy or who
had committed some other specified acts, and
might punish those whom they adjudged to
be guilty with imprisonment for three months
or banishment for seven years. Persons
opposed to liberty and independence were
prohibited from the practice of law in the
courts; and any parent whose sons went off
and adhered to the enemy was subject to a
tax of ninepence in the pound value of such
parent’s estate for each and every such son.</p>

<p>The Congress naturally left such matters
largely to the individual states, but nevertheless
passed a resolution subjecting to martial
law and death all who should furnish provisions,
etc., to the British army in New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, and resolved
that all loyalists taken in arms should
be sent to the states to which they belonged,
there to be dealt with as traitors.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>In regard to this subject of legal attainder
and exile, Mr. Sabine remarks very moderately
and sensibly: “Nor is it believed that
either the banishment, or the confiscation
laws, as they stood, were more expedient
than just. The latter did little towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
relieving the public necessities, and served
only to create a disposition for rapacity, and
to increase the wealth of favored individuals.
Had the estates, which were seized and sold,
been judiciously or honestly managed, a
considerable sum would have found its way
to the treasury; but, as it was, the amount
was inconsiderable, some of the wisest and
purest Whigs of the time hung their heads
in shame, because of the passage of measures
so unjustifiable, and never ceased to speak
of them in terms of severe reprobation. Mr.
Jay’s disgust was unconquerable, and he
never would purchase any property that had
been forfeited under the Confiscation Act of
New York.”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>Curwen, a Salem loyalist who was allowed
to return after the war, writes in terms
that, though exaggerated, yet describe the
result upon public morals of the confiscations:</p>

<p>“So infamously knavish has been the conduct
of the commissioners, that though
frequent attempts have been made to bring
them to justice, and respond for the produce
of the funds resting in their hands, so
numerous are the defaulters in <em>that august
body</em>, the General Court, that all efforts have
hitherto proved in vain. Not twopence in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
the pound have arrived to the public treasury
of all the confiscations.”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>It only now remains to notice the treatment
the unfortunate loyalists received from their
friends in England and the manner in which
the British government—for which they had
sacrificed home, friends, and property, and
had embraced exile, contempt, and penury—threw
them upon the tender mercies of their
opponents in the treaty of peace. This surrender
of their interests by Lord Shelburne
called out, in both Houses of the Parliament,
expressions of sympathetic indignation; but
the sympathy never took any material shape.
Sheridan, in the House of Commons, execrated
the treatment of these unfortunate
men, “who, without the least notice taken
of their civil and religious rights, were
handed over as subjects to a power that
would not fail to take vengeance on them for
their zeal and attachment to the religion and
government of the ‘mother country.’” In
the House of Lords, Lord Loughborough
said, “that neither in ancient nor modern
history had there been so shameful a desertion
of men who had sacrificed all to their
duty and to their reliance upon British faith.”</p>

<p>To such charges Lord Shelburne could only
reply by a feeble appeal to the mercy of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
condemners: “I have but one answer to give
the House; it is the answer I give my own
bleeding heart. A part must be wounded
that the whole of the empire may not
perish. If better terms could be had, think
you, my lords, that I would not have embraced
them? I had but the alternative
either to accept the terms proposed or continue
the war.”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>Lord Shelburne’s statement was correct.
He had entered upon the negotiations for
peace full of sympathy for the loyalists and
resolved to make their cause the cause of
England; but when, to his attempts to obtain
for them the restoration of their property
and the abolition of penal laws, was opposed
a steady <i lang="la">non possumus</i>, his enthusiasm for
his persecuted fellow-countrymen waned;
and when at last it was plainly suggested to
him that a year’s prolongation of the war
would cost more than all the loyalists’ property
put together, he consented to accept
the assurance, the futility and emptiness of
which was evident upon the face of it, that
“Congress shall earnestly recommend” to
the several states to repeal the laws of attainder
and confiscation which had been
passed against the Tories and their property.
One of the American negotiators brusquely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
remarked that it was better and more proper
that the loyalists should be compensated by
their friends than by their enemies. This
desertion of their interests almost broke the
hearts of some of the best and most public-spirited
of the loyalists, who had given up
everything for the cause of their country,
and now saw themselves consigned to poverty
in their old age, or at the best to supplicating
aid of the British government and being
exposed to all “the insolence of office and the
scorns that patient merit of the unworthy
takes.”<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<p>It took a long time to adjust the claims
and to distribute the bounty which was doled
out by unwilling officials. It was 1783 when
the war closed, but not until 1790 was the
indemnity paid out to the claimants; and
then England forced her unfortunate pensioners,
made paupers by their trust in her,
to accept about £3,300,000 for losses reckoned
at over £8,000,000. It is estimated that
over a thousand claimants had in the mean
time perished in want and penury. Those
were on the whole more fortunate, as events
proved, who had braved it out in America
than were those who had trusted to the
gratitude of England.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></p>

<p>What was the loss of America was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
gain to her nearest neighbors, the coast provinces
of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
As early as 1775 the exodus from Boston to
Halifax had begun; and when Howe evacuated
the city, a large number of loyalists
took refuge with the fleet and army,
and leaving all behind came to Halifax
to seek their fortunes under another sky.
From that time on, throughout the war,
Halifax was the haven of refuge for persecuted
loyalists.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> At the evacuation of New
York and Savannah no fewer than 30,000
persons left the United States for Nova
Scotia. Halifax was so crowded that houses
could not be had at any price, and provisions
were held at famine prices.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> From northern
New York and Vermont the loyalists
crossed over into Upper Canada and laid the
foundation of that prosperous province under
the vigorous government of Governor Simcoe,
who during the war had commanded a
regiment of loyalist rangers which had
done efficient service.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> With many a suffering,
many a privation, these exiles for conscience’
sake toiled to make homes for themselves
in the wilderness, and it is to them
that the development of those provinces is
due. Familiar New England names meet
one at every turn in these provinces,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
especially in Nova Scotia. Dr. Inglis of
Trinity Church, New York, was the first
bishop, and Judge Sewall of Massachusetts,
the first chief justice there. The harshness
of the laws and the greed of the new commonwealths
thus drove into exile men who could
be ill spared, and whose absence showed itself
in the lack of balance and of political steadiness
that characterized the early history of
the Republic. This, moreover, perpetuated a
traditional dislike, grudge, and suspicion
between the people of the United States and
their nearest neighbors, men of the same
blood and the same speech; while the new-founded
colonies, composed almost exclusively
of conservatives, were naturally slow,
if sure, in their development.</p>

<p>This dislike and suspicion is now fortunately
diminishing with the lapse of years, but
it was a great pity it ever was created. The
men who were willing to give up home,
friends, and property for an idea, are not
men to be despised or laughed at, as was the
fashion of the generation which roared with
delight over the coarse buffooneries of Trumbull’s
McFingal. They are rather men for us to
claim with pride, and to honor as Americans,
Americans who were true to their convictions
of duty, confessors for their political faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>Sabine relates the following conversation:</p>

<p>“‘Why did you come here, when you and
your associates were almost certain to endure
the sufferings and absolute want of shelter
and food which you have now narrated?’
asked an American gentleman of one of the
first settlers of St. John, New Brunswick, a
man whose life ... was without a stain.
‘Why did we come here?’ replied he, with
emotion that brought tears;—‘for our loyalty;
think you that our principles were not
as dear to us as were yours to you?’”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_152" href="#FNanchor_152" class="label">152</a> Franklin’s <i>Memoirs</i> (London, 1818, p. 201), (Sparks, p.
176). “In 1754, war with France being again apprehended,
a congress of commissioners from the different
colonies was by an order of the lords of trade to be assembled
in Albany; there to confer with the chiefs of
the six nations, concerning the means of defending both
their country and ours.</p>

<p>We met the other commissioners at Albany about the
middle of June. In our way thither I projected and
drew up a plan for the union of all the colonies under
one government, so far as might be necessary for defence,
and other important general purposes. As we
passed through New York, I had there shown my project
to Mr. James Alexander and Mr. Kennedy, two gentlemen
of great knowledge in public affairs, and being
fortified by their approbation, I ventured to lay it before
the congress. It then appeared that several of the commissioners
had formed plans of the same kind. A previous
question was first taken, whether a union should
be established, which passed in the affirmative, unanimously.
A committee was then appointed, one member
from each colony, to consider the several plans and report.
Mine happened to be preferred, and with a few
amendments was accordingly reported. By this plan the
general government was to be administered by a President
General appointed and supported by the Crown;
and a grand Council to be chosen by the representatives
of the people of the several colonies met in their respective
assemblies. The debates upon it in congress went
on daily hand in hand with the Indian business. Many
objections and difficulties were started, but at length they
were all overcome, and the plan was unanimously agreed
to, and copies ordered to be transmitted to the board of
trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces. Its
fate was singular: the assemblies did not adopt it, as
they all thought there was too much prerogative in it;
and in England it was judged to have too much of the
democratic. The different and contrary reasons of dislike
to my plan make me suspect that it was really the
true medium: and I am still of opinion it would have
been happy for both sides if it had been adopted. The
colonies so united would have been sufficiently strong to
have defended themselves: there would then have been
no need of troops from England; of course the subsequent
pretext for taxing America, and the bloody contest it
occasioned, would have been avoided.”</p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_153" href="#FNanchor_153" class="label">153</a> The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
Foreign Parts was founded in 1701. A previous organization
bearing a similar name had been founded during the
period of the Commonwealth, especially for work among
the aborigines in New England, and it is to this association
that we owe that most interesting of missionary
relics, Eliot’s Indian Bible. Great interest was taken in
this by the celebrated Robert Boyle, and scholarships were
endowed by Sir Leoline Jenkyns in Jesus College, Oxford,
one condition of which was that the beneficiary should
devote his life after taking his degree to missionary work
in the plantations. The reports of Commissary Bray,
who had been sent out to Maryland, of the spiritual destitution
of the American colonies and of the difficulties
under which the ministers of the Church of England
labored, led to the organization and incorporation of the
Society, which has been from that day to this an active
agency in the spread of religion and knowledge in the
colonies of Great Britain. Humphreys, <i>Historical Account

“To guard against the incursions of the Indians a plan
was sent over to America (and, as I think, by authority)
suggesting the expediency of clearing away the woods

why a party, so large in numbers, which in so many
colonies included persons so respectable, and hitherto so

to breaking away from British dominion. These questions
have been put to loyalists themselves. They have
answered, that, upon the original formation of parties,
they were generally regarded as the common organizations
of the ins and outs; the one striving to retain, and
the other to gain, patronage and place; and that the
mass in taking sides with or against the royal governors,
were stimulated by the hopes which politicians have
always been able to excite in their followers.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_161" href="#FNanchor_161" class="label">161</a> A specimen from a comparatively moderate article
upon the loyalists may serve to substantiate the statement
of the text (<i>No. Am. Rev.</i>, lxv. p. 142): “The
meanest, most dastardly, and most cruel scenes and deeds
of the Revolution were enacted as the proper fruits of a
civil war by a large majority of the Tories, who remained
at home, and who, as regulars, as volunteers, in gangs,
or as individual outlaws, were the instigators of nearly
every foul and atrocious act in the whole strife. It is
from these, the majority of the whole number, that the
name of Tory has received its hateful associations, which
will cling to it to the end of time. A class that includes
an Arnold and a Butler can never hope for complete redemption,
at least so long as Judas remains in ‘his own
place.’”</p>

<p>One is glad to appeal from this intemperate and exaggerated
language to the essay upon the loyalists by Dr.
George E. Ellis, in Winsor’s <i>Narrative and Critical History</i>,
vol. vii. It would be as undesirable as it is unnecessary
to supply, as could readily be done, instances of gross
cruelty and barbarity inflicted by the Whigs upon the
unfortunate loyalists “who remained at home.” The
Correspondence of Lord Cornwallis gives a most painful
picture of the condition of things in the South (<i>Corr.</i>, i.
73), and the letters of Count Fersen, who cannot be suspected
of prejudice, reveal the hardly less savage condition
of affairs in the North. He says, for example, of
Rhode Island (<i>Letters</i>, i. 40, 41):</p>

<p lang="fr">“C’est un pays qui sera fort heureux s’il jouit d’une
paix longue, et si les deux partis qui le divisent à present
ne lui font subir le sort de la Pologne et de tant d’autres
républiques. Ces deux partes sont appelés les Whigs et
les Torys. Le premier est entièrement pour la liberté et
l’independance; il est composé de gens de la plus basse
extraction qui ne possédent point de biens; la plupart
des habitants de la compagne en sont. Les Torys sont
pour les Anglais, ou, pour mieux dire, pour la paix, sans
trop se soucier d’être libres ou dépendants; ce sont les
gens d’une classe plus distinguée, les seuls qui eussent des
biens dans le pays. Lorsque les Whigs sont les plus forts,
ils pillent les autres tant qu’ils peuvent.”</p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_163" href="#FNanchor_163" class="label">163</a> The Americans made several attempts to make use
of the Indians: Montgomery used them in his Canadian
expedition; they were in the New England army which
laid siege to Boston; in April, 1776, Washington wrote to
Congress urging their employment in the army, and
reported on July 13th that, without special authority, he
had directed General Schuyler to engage the Six Nations
on the best terms he and his colleagues could procure;
and again, submitting the propriety of engaging the
Eastern Indians. John Adams thought “we need not
be so delicate as to refuse me assistance of Indians,
provided we cannot keep them neutral.” A treaty was
exchanged with the Eastern Indians on July 17, 1776,
whereby they agreed to furnish six hundred Indians for
a regiment which was to be officered by the whites. As
a result of this, the Massachusetts Council subsequently
reported that seven Penobscot Indians, all that could be
procured, were enlisted in October for one year; and in
November Major Shaw reported with a few Indians who
had enlisted in the Continental service. Winsor, <i>Narr.
and Crit. Hist.</i>, vol. vi. 656, 657. The following brief
entry in a diary will show that even among the patriot
forces savage customs sometimes found place: “On
Monday the 30th sent out a party for some dead Indians.
Toward morning found them, and skinned two of them
from their hips down for boot legs: one pair for the
major, the other for myself.” <i>Proceedings N.&nbsp;J. Hist.

opponents of the Revolution were powerful in all the
thirteen colonies; in some of them they were nearly
if not quite equal in number to its friends the Whigs.
On the departure of Hutchinson he was addressed by
upwards of two hundred merchants, lawyers and other
citizens of Boston, Salem and Marblehead. On arrival
of Gage, forty-eight from Salem presented their dutiful
respects; on his retirement he received the ‘Loyal address
from gentlemen and principal inhabitants of Boston’ to
the number of ninety-seven, and eighteen country
gentlemen and official personages who had taken refuge
in Boston.” ...</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>“The division of parties in Connecticut, Rhode Island
and New Hampshire was much the same as in Massachusetts.
New York was the loyalists’ stronghold, and
contained more of them than any colony in America.
While proof to sustain this assertion can be adduced to
almost any extent, we shall cite but a single though
conclusive fact; namely, that soon after the close of the
war the Assembly of that State passed a bill prohibiting
adherents of the crown from holding office, which was
objected to and returned by the Council of Revision,
who, among other reasons for their course, stated, that
if it were suffered to become a law, there would be
difficulty, and in some places an impossibility, of finding
men of different political sympathies, even to conduct
the elections. In some of the southern colonies, the
loyalists were almost as numerous as in New York. In
the Carolinas it may be hard to determine which party
had the majority; and it will be found that there were
occasions when the royal generals obtained twelve or
fifteen hundred recruits among the inhabitants, merely
by issuing a proclamation or call upon them to stand
by their allegiance to “the best of sovereigns.... Few
of the Carolinians would enlist under the American
banner; but after the capitulation (of Charlestown) they
flocked to the royal standard by hundreds.” See also

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_166" href="#FNanchor_166" class="label">166</a> A.&nbsp;W. Farmer, <i>The Congress Canvassed</i>, pp. 17–19,
exhibits the manner in which delegates to Congress
were chosen in New York. “The New York City committee
(a self-appointed body) applied to the supervisors
in the several counties to call the people together and to
choose committees, which committees were to meet in
one grand committee; and this grand committee of
committees were to choose the delegates for the county
or to declare their approbation of the New York delegates,
and if any county did not meet and choose their committee
it was to be taken for granted that they acquiesced
in the New York choice.” Again as to delegates chosen
by the Assemblies: “The Assembly has no legal right
to act by itself and claim to represent the people in so
doing. The people are not bound by any act of their
representatives till it hath received the approbation of
the other branches of the legislature. Delegates so
appointed are, at best, but delegates of delegates, but
representatives of representatives. When therefore the
delegates at Philadelphia, in the preamble to their Bill
of Rights, and in their letter to his Excellency General
Gage, stiled their body ‘a full and free representation
of ... all the Colonies from Nova Scotia to Georgia,’
they were guilty of a piece of impudence which was
never equalled since the world began, and never will be
exceeded while it shall continue.” Again: “No provincial
legislature (even if complete) can give them such
powers as were lately exercised at Philadelphia. The
legislative authority of the province cannot extend
further than the province extends. None of its acts
are binding one inch beyond its limits. How then can
it give authority to a few persons, to make rules
and laws for the whole continent?... Before such a
mode of legislation can take place, the constitution of our
colonies must be subverted and their present independency
on one another must be annihilated.”</p>

<p>The logic of the loyalist writers is unanswerable, and
their legal reasoning is usually correct and precise; the
fallacy of their position was that they were in face of a
revolution. Elements had been introduced into the
struggle which, like the presence of an infinite quantity
in an equation, vitiated the reasoning, however correct
the process may have been. The author argues, for
example: “To talk of subjection to the King of Great
Britain, while we disclaim submission to the Parliament
of Great Britain, is idle and ridiculous. It is a distinction
made by the American Republicans to serve their
own rebellious purposes, a gilding with which they have
enclosed the pill of sedition, to entice the unwary colonists
to swallow it the more readily down. The King of
Great Britain was placed on the throne by virtue of an
Act of Parliament: And he is king of America, by virtue
of being king of Great Britain. He is therefore king of
America by Act of Parliament. And if we disclaim that
authority which made him our king, we, in fact, reject
him from being our king, for we disclaim that authority
by which he is king at all.” It may be noticed that the
fundamental Whig doctrine of the supremacy of Parliament,
which is here so strongly urged, was never understood
or appreciated by those who called themselves
Whigs in America.</p>

The following extracts may be added to those given in
the text; Mr. Burke said: “Better to have left the whole
to future negotiation, and to have been totally silent upon
the subject in the treaty, than to have consented to have
set our hands to a gross libel on the national character,
and in our flagitious article plunged the dagger into the
hearts of the loyalists, and manifested our own impotency,
ingratitude and disgrace” (p. 468). In the same
debate Mr. Lee said: “Europe, Asia, Africa and America
beheld the dismembership and diminution of the
British Empire. But this, alarming and calamitous as it
was, was nothing when put in competition with another
of the crimes of the present peace, the cession of men
into the hands of their enemies, and delivering over to
confiscation, tyranny, resentment and oppression the unhappy
men who trusted to our fair promises and deceitful
words. This was the great ground of his objection:
and he called it a disgraceful, wicked and treacherous
peace; inadequate to its object, and such as no man
could vote to be honorable without delivering his character
over to damnation for ever” (p. 492).</p>

and resentment at the treatment they had received from
the hands of their friends, is well exhibited in Judge
Jones’s remarkable work, which, however trustworthy or
the reverse it may be in other respects, may be followed
implicitly as an exhibition of loyalist feeling towards the
mother country.</p>

Thomas Hutchinson</i>, ii. 435–437. Sabine, i. 86–90. In
March, 1784, the number of persons who had preferred
their petitions was 2,063, and the alleged losses £7,046,278,
besides outstanding debts in America amounting to
£2,354,135. “In 1788 Mr. Pitt submitted a plan for
classifying the claimants, and of classifying and apportioning
the nature and amount of consolation to be
allotted to each; and to those whose losses had been
caused principally by the deprivation of official or professional
incomes, he proposed a system of pensions.
By the 5th of April, this year (1790), the Commissioners
in England had heard and determined 1,680 claims, and
had liquidated the same at the sum of £1,887,548. It
appeared, finally, that the number of applicants from
England, and from the Canadian provinces, attained to
the aggregate of 5,072, of which 954 either withdrew their
applications or failed to press them, and the sum of the
losses is stated to have been £8,026,045. Another return
is made out by Mr. J.&nbsp;E. Wilmot, one of the Commissioners,
wherein the amount of the claim is given as
£10,358,413, and the amount of the claims allowed at
£3,033,091. The subject was again raised in Parliament
in 1821, but though there was much sympathy expressed
for the sufferings of those who had trusted to their
country to recompense their fidelity, the sympathy exhausted
itself in words.” See also Lecky, <i>England in the
Eighteenth Century</i>, iv. 268. Curwen, 367, 368.</p>

Roberts, <i>Hist. of New York</i>, ii. 449 ff. Lecky (<i>Hist. England

sharply: “The loyalists to a great extent sprung from and
represented the old gentry of the country. The prospect
of seizing their property had been one great motive
which induced many to enter the war. The owners of
the confiscated property now grasped the helm. New
men exercised the social influence of the old families,
and they naturally dreaded the restoration of those whom
they had displaced.”</p>

the loyalists may be added: “There were brave and
honest men in America who were proud of the great and
free empire to which they belonged, who had no desire
to shrink from the burden of maintaining it, who remembered
with gratitude the English blood that had
been shed around Quebec and Montreal, and who, with
nothing to hope for from the crown, were prepared to
face the most brutal mob violence and the invectives of
a scurrilous press, to risk their fortunes, their reputations,
and sometimes even their lives, in order to avert civil
war and ultimate separation. Most of them ended
their days in poverty and exile, and as the supporters of
a beaten cause history has paid but a scanty tribute to
their memory, but they comprised some of the best and
ablest men America has ever produced, and they were
contending for an ideal which was at least as worthy
as that for which Washington fought. The maintenance
of one free, industrial and pacific empire, comprising
the whole English race, may have been a dream, but it
was at least a noble one.” <i>History of England in the
Eighteenth Century</i>, iii. 418. For historical notices of
the loyalists in Canada, the following are also useful:
